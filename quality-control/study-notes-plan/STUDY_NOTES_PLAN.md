# Plain Meaning Study Notes - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document tracks the systematic addition of Plain Meaning Study Notes to all 66 books of the Plain Meaning Bible. Notes are added where modern readers would miss the plain meaning that the original audience understood immediately.

## Core Principle
Notes must ONLY provide factual cultural/historical background that 2025 readers lack. No theological interpretation, no apologetics, no explaining away difficult texts. If the original audience understood it immediately, modern readers should too - we just provide the missing background knowledge.

## Theological Constraint
All notes must comply with Free Grace soteriology. No notes that imply works-based salvation, lordship salvation, or loss of salvation.

2. Maintain consistent note style across all books
3. Regular review to ensure quality and consistency

## Critical Concepts Requiring Consistent Treatment

### Ancient Cosmology (What They Saw)
- **Three-tier universe**: Waters above (rain), sky/firmament (solid dome), earth, waters below (springs/sea)
- **Heavens (plural)**: Multiple layers - birds' atmosphere, stars' realm, God's dwelling
- **Pillars of earth**: Mountains seen as holding up the sky
- **Sheol location**: Underground gathering place of all dead
- **Heart/kidneys/bowels**: Heart = thinking, kidneys = emotions, bowels = compassion (opposite of modern usage)

### Daily Life Realities Unknown Today
- **City gate**: Marketplace, courthouse, business center, public square all in one
- **Flat roofs**: Used as extra room, sleeping area, work space, announcement platform
- **One-room houses**: Entire families in single room with animals
- **Oil lamps**: Only light source after dark, "trimming wicks" = maintaining only light
- **Grinding grain**: Daily women's work taking hours, hand millstones
- **Water drawing**: Daily trek to communal well, social gathering time

### Agricultural/Pastoral Context
- **Former and latter rains**: October-November planting rain, March-April harvest rain - crop life or death
- **Gleaning rights**: Legal requirement to leave field edges for poor
- **Threshing floor**: Flat hilltop for wind to separate grain from chaff
- **Winnowing**: Tossing grain in air for wind to blow away chaff
- **Firstfruits**: First ripe portion (not best), showing harvest has begun
- **Shepherding**: Leading from front (not driving from behind), personal knowledge of each sheep

### Economic Systems
- **Denarius**: Day's wage for laborer
- **Talent**: 20 years' wages (not a skill)
- **Mina**: 3 months' wages
- **Tithe**: Government tax system, not voluntary giving
- **Jubilee**: 50-year debt cancellation and land return
- **Gleaning**: Welfare system through harvest rights

### Social Customs
- **Hospitality obligation**: Refusing guests brought shame on entire community
- **Foot washing**: Slave's task, arriving guests covered in road dust
- **Reclining at meals**: Lying on side at formal dinners, not sitting
- **Right hand of honor**: Position of equal status and authority
- **Greeting kiss**: Standard greeting like handshake today
- **Torn clothes**: Formal mourning expression, not random emotion

## Specific Misunderstandings from Missing Context

### Words/Phrases That Mean Something Different
- **"Talent"** - Amount of money (20 years wages), not ability
- **"Take up your cross"** - Death march of condemned criminal, not daily burden
- **"Gird up your loins"** - Tuck robe into belt to run, not spiritual preparation
- **"White as snow"** - Purity/cleansing (snow was rare, special), not just color
- **"Living water"** - Running water from spring vs still water from cistern
- **"Daily bread"** - Tomorrow's bread (planning ahead), not just today's

## Research Methodology and Sources

### Primary Source Categories
1. **Ancient Near Eastern Texts**: Creation myths, law codes, treaties for OT context
2. **Second Temple Literature**: Dead Sea Scrolls, Apocrypha, Pseudepigrapha for NT context
3. **Greco-Roman Sources**: Philosophical schools, mystery religions, imperial cult
4. **Rabbinic Literature**: Mishnah, Talmud for Jewish interpretation traditions
5. **Early Church Fathers**: Cultural assumptions of early readers

### Verification Process
- Cross-reference multiple scholarly sources
- Prefer archaeological evidence over speculation
- Check against ancient primary sources when possible
- Avoid depending on single scholarly theories
- Update notes when new evidence emerges

## Editorial Style Guide for Notes

### Writing Principles
1. **Brevity**: 1-3 sentences maximum per note
2. **Accessibility**: Explain as to intelligent 14-year-old
3. **Objectivity**: "Ancient Israelites believed..." not "This means..."
4. **Specificity**: Concrete examples over abstract concepts
5. **Relevance**: Only what changes understanding of the passage

### Standard Formulations
- "In ancient [culture], [practice] meant..."
- "The original audience would have understood this as..."
- "[Term] referred to [explanation], not modern [misconception]"
- "This reflects the ancient practice of..."
- "In the honor-shame culture of the time..."

### What NOT to Write
- ❌ "This teaches us..." (application)
- ❌ "Christians believe..." (theology)  
- ❌ "This probably means..." (speculation)
- ❌ "As we see in [other passage]..." (cross-reference)
- ❌ "This symbolizes..." (allegorical interpretation)
- ❌ "This doesn't really mean..." (explaining away difficult texts)
- ❌ Any soteriological interpretation contrary to Free Grace
- ❌ Any note that adds conditions to salvation beyond faith alone
- ❌ Apologetic explanations that soften hard passages

## Testing and Validation Framework

### Reader Comprehension Testing
1. **Before/After Test**: Have readers explain passage meaning before and after reading note
2. **Cultural Distance Check**: Would a reader from different culture need this explained?
3. **Misunderstanding Prevention**: Does note prevent common wrong interpretation?
4. **Reading Flow Test**: Does note integrate smoothly or disrupt reading?

### Note Necessity Criteria
Must meet at least one:
- [ ] Prevents harmful misinterpretation
- [ ] Explains foreign concept with no modern equivalent
- [ ] Clarifies meaning that translation alone cannot convey
- [ ] Provides essential historical context for events
- [ ] Illuminates wordplay or rhetoric invisible in translation

## Specific Challenging Concepts Requiring Special Care

### Concepts with No Modern Equivalent
- **Hesed**: Covenant loyalty/loving-kindness/steadfast love complex
- **Shalom**: Wholeness/peace/prosperity/relationship complex
- **Righteousness/Justice**: Single concept in Hebrew (tzedakah/mishpat)
- **Fear of the Lord**: Reverent awe/allegiance, not terror
- **Glory/Honor**: Physical weightiness and social standing
- **Name**: Essential identity, not just label

### Modern Assumptions to Correct
- Reading romantic love into arranged marriages
- Assuming modern individualism in collectivist society
- Projecting democracy onto monarchic/theocratic systems
- Imposing scientific worldview on phenomenological descriptions
- Expecting historical chronology in thematic arrangements
- Assuming literacy in oral culture

### Translation Challenges Requiring Notes

### Genesis 4:7 - "sin is crouching at your door"
**Note**: "Ancient Near Eastern imagery of a demon or wild animal literally waiting outside the door to attack."

### Exodus 21:6 - "pierce his ear with an awl"
**Note**: "Piercing the ear against the doorpost marked permanent voluntary servitude, visible to all."

### Luke 15:8 - "ten silver coins"
**Note**: "A drachma was a day's wage. Ten coins likely represented her dowry, worn as a headdress or necklace."

**Note**: "Foot washing was the lowest slave's task. Guests arrived with feet dirty from walking in sandals on dusty roads."

### Acts 17:18 - "Epicurean and Stoic philosophers"
**Note**: "Epicureans sought happiness through pleasure; Stoics through emotionless virtue. Both major Greek philosophical schools."

- 16:23 - "Erastus the city treasurer" (high social status unusual for Christian)

## Linguistic Phenomena Requiring Explanation

### Hebrew Language Features
- **Parallelism**: Hebrew poetry repeats ideas in different words - not separate points
- **Merism**: Pairs of opposites meaning "everything" (heavens and earth = universe)
- **Hebraisms**: "Son of" means characterized by (son of peace = peaceful person)
- **Divine passive**: "It was given" often means "God gave"
- **Prophetic perfect**: Past tense for future certainty
- **Intensive plural**: Plural form for emphasis, not multiple (Elohim, Adonim)

### Greek Language Features  
- **Aspect vs Tense**: Greek verbs emphasize type of action more than time
- **Middle voice**: Acting upon oneself, no English equivalent
- **Optative mood**: Wishes/possibilities, often lost in translation
- **Emphatic negation**: Double negatives strengthen rather than cancel
- **Semitisms**: Greek written by Hebrew thinkers retains Hebrew patterns

### Translation Decisions Affecting Meaning
- **Gender language**: Masculine plurals included women in ancient usage
- **Singular/plural "you"**: English loses distinction crucial for interpretation
- **Active/passive voice**: "God hardened" vs "Pharaoh's heart was hardened"
- **Word order emphasis**: First position = emphasis in Greek, lost in English
- **Untranslatable particles**: Greek "men...de" showing contrast

## Common Misunderstandings Priority List

### Must Address Immediately (Pure Cultural Context)
1. **Money/wage references** - Denarius = day's wage, talent = 20 years wages, mite = 1/64 day's wage
2. **Time references** - Third hour = 9 AM, watches of night, Sabbath day's journey = 1,000 yards
3. **Agricultural terms** - Former/latter rains, winnowing, threshing floor operations
4. **Clothing/appearance** - Girding loins, sackcloth and ashes, torn garments
5. **Legal customs** - City gate court, witnesses requirements, kinsman-redeemer role
6. **Hospitality codes** - Foot washing, providing water/food/shelter obligations
7. **Geographic directions** - "Going up" to Jerusalem from any direction
8. **Housing structures** - Upper room, flat roofs as living space, one-room houses
9. **Meal customs** - Reclining at table, place of honor, common cup

## Notes
- This is a long-term project requiring systematic work
- Each book may need 20-100+ notes depending on cultural distance
- Priority on clarity over comprehensiveness
- Notes should enhance, not interrupt, reading flow
- Success = modern reader understands like ancient audience
- When in doubt, test with someone unfamiliar with ancient culture

## Specific Notes to Add
