\# Vibe Bible Translation



A Bible translation under MIT license developed with AI. The translation aim is to convey precise meaning while straying from the original wording as far as necessary. This is a meaning-driven translation for readers who want to understand exactly what the text meant to its original audience, not a simplified children's Bible.



\## Source Texts

Uses a critical apparatus as source. The translation never varies from what is stated as most likely in the critical apparatus, regardless of church tradition.



\## Translation Approach

\- The English is without grammar errors.

\- The Bible uses a functional equivalent translation method and differs from the original as far as necessary to convey the actual meaning to the original audience. The translation does whatever it takes to convey the meaning, even if this means replacing words that have no equivalent in English with half sentences.

\- Idioms are translated to convey the meaning, even if this destroys the exact wording.

\- The goal is to convey the original meaning as precisely as possible.

\- The word order of the translation follows natural English word order, not Greek word order when this is not the natural way of writing.



\## Translation Choices

\- YHWH (יהוה) is rendered as Yahweh in the Old Testament while κύριος (kyrios) is rendered as Lord in the New Testament. There is no matching here with the Old Testament.

\- All divine names (El, Elohim, El Shaddai, Adonai) are translated as "God"

\- The translation does not use the generic masculine where it is outdated in English.

\- Deity pronouns are not capitalized.

\- Time references are modernized (e.g., "third hour" → "9 AM")

\- Cultural measurements include both original and modern meaning (e.g., "a Sabbath day's journey, about half a mile")

\- Monetary values include both original and equivalent (e.g., "a denarius, a day's wage")

\- Capitalization follows standard English grammar rules

\- Protestant versification system is used



\## Interpretative Choices

\- The translation avoids all references to Classical Trinitarianism but prefers a Social Trinitarian reading (unique Son instead of begotten Son)

\- The translation does not violate a Free Grace reading of passages that could be translated differently.

\- The translation is faithful to the Bible being fully true. E.g., The prophecy about Mary is about a virgin, not about a young woman.



\## Word Choices

\## Notes and Annotations

Notes should only provide factual data to help readers understand the translation choices, never interpretative commentary:

**ALLOWED in notes:**
- Linguistic data: "The Greek word X means Y"
- Cultural context needed for understanding: "A denarius was a day's wage"
- Measurement conversions: "A cubit is about 18 inches"
- Idiom explanations: "This Hebrew phrase means..."

**NEVER ALLOWED in notes:**
- Speculation about people's motives: "He appears to have been..."
- Historical interpretation: "This probably refers to..."
- Theological commentary: "This shows that..."
- Narrative explanation: "The situation was..."
- Editorial analysis: "The author is emphasizing..."
- Manuscript variants: "Some manuscripts read..." (we follow critical consensus only)

If the meaning requires explanation, it should be built into the translation itself using functional equivalence, not added as interpretative notes.
