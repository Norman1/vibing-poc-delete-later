      <title type="main">Jesus Comes to Jerusalem as King</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.1">As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.2">saying to them, "Go to the village ahead of you, and just as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.3">If anyone asks you, 'Why are you doing this?' say, 'The Lord needs it and will send it back here shortly.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.4">They went and found a colt outside in the street, tied at a doorway. As they untied it,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.5">some people standing there asked, "What are you doing, untying that colt?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.6">They answered as Jesus had told them to, and the people let them go.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.7">When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, he sat on it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.8">Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut in the fields.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.9">Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, "Hosanna!<note type="translation">A Hebrew expression meaning "Save!" which became an exclamation of praise</note> Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.10">"Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest heaven!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.11">Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Curses a Fig Tree and Clears the Temple Courts</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.12">The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.13">Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.14">Then he said to the tree, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again." And his disciples heard him say it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.15">On reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple courts and began driving out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.16">and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.17">And as he taught them, he said, "Is it not written: 'My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations'? But you have made it 'a den of robbers.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.18">The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him, for they feared him, because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.19">When evening came, Jesus and his disciples went out of the city.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.20">In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.21">Peter remembered and said to Jesus, "Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.22">"Have faith in God," Jesus answered.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.23">"Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.24">Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.25">And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Authority of Jesus Questioned</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.27">They arrived again in Jerusalem, and while Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders came to him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.28">"By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you authority to do this?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.29">Jesus replied, "I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.30">John's baptismâ€”was it from heaven, or of human origin? Tell me!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.31">They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.32">But if we say, 'Of human origin'..." (They feared the people, for everyone held that John really was a prophet.)</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.33">So they answered Jesus, "We don't know." Jesus said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things."</verse>
