      <title type="main">Teaching About Divorce</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.1">Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Again crowds of people came to him, and as was his custom, he taught them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.2">Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.3">"What did Moses command you?" he replied.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.4">They said, "Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.5">"It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law," Jesus replied.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.6">"But at the beginning of creation God 'made them male and female.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.7">'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.8">and the two will become one flesh.' So they are no longer two, but one flesh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.9">Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.10">When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.11">He answered, "Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.12">And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Little Children and Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.13">People were bringing little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them, but the disciples rebuked them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.14">When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.15">Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.16">And he took the children in his arms, placed his hands on them and blessed them.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Rich Young Man</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.17">As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. "Good teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.18">"Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No one is good—except God alone.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.19">You know the commandments: 'You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, you shall not defraud, honor your father and mother.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.20">"Teacher," he declared, "all these I have kept since I was a boy."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.21">Jesus looked at him and loved him. "One thing you lack," he said. "Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.22">At this the man's face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.23">Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.24">The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, "Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.25">It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.26">The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, "Who then can be saved?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.27">Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.28">Then Peter spoke up, "We have left everything to follow you!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.29">"Truly I tell you," Jesus replied, "no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.30">will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age: homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields—along with persecutions—and in the age to come eternal life.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.31">But many who are first will be last, and the last first."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Predicts His Death a Third Time</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.32">They were on their way up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid. Again he took the Twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.33">"We are going up to Jerusalem," he said, "and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.34">who will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Request of James and John</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.35">Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. "Teacher," they said, "we want you to do for us whatever we ask."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.36">"What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.37">They replied, "Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.38">"You don't know what you are asking," Jesus said. "Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.39">"We can," they answered. Jesus said to them, "You will drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.40">but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.41">When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.42">Jesus called them together and said, "You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.43">Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.44">and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.45">For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Blind Bartimaeus Receives His Sight</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.46">Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (which means "son of Timaeus"), was sitting by the roadside begging.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.47">When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.48">Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.49">Jesus stopped and said, "Call him." So they called to the blind man, "Cheer up! On your feet! He's calling you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.50">Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.51">"What do you want me to do for you?" Jesus asked him. The blind man said, "Rabbi,<note type="translation">The Aramaic word "Rabboni" means "my teacher"</note> I want to see."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.52">"Go," said Jesus, "your faith has healed you." Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.</verse>
