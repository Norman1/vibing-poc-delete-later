## Translation Approach

### Core Translation Principles

1. **Grammar and Language Quality**
   - The English must be without grammar errors
   - All text must maintain proper English syntax and readability
   - Professional editing standards applied throughout

2. **Translation Method**
   - Literal translation approach while preserving natural English flow
   - Formal equivalence preferred, but dynamic equivalence used when literal rendering would obscure meaning
   - The translation should be literal but the English must always remain proper English
   - Follow natural English word order for smooth reading (not Hebrew/Greek order)

3. **Divine Name Rendering**
   - YHWH (יהוה) rendered as "Yahweh" in Old Testament
   - κύριος (kyrios) rendered as "Lord" in New Testament (no matching required)
   - Adonai (אדני) rendered as "Lord"
   - Elohim (אלהים) rendered as "God"

4. **Idiom and Cultural Context**
   - Hebrew and Greek idioms translated literally when possible
   - If there is an idiom, explain it in the footnotes
   - Cultural background provided in critical apparatus when necessary

5. **Critical Apparatus Requirements**
   - Always use the critical apparatus for scholarly transparency
   - Priority 1: Linguistic data (original text, Strong's numbers, morphology)
   - Priority 2: Cultural/historical context (measurements, customs, idioms)
   - Priority 3: Textual information when manuscript differences affect meaning
   - No theological interpretation - only factual scholarly data

### Theological Guidelines

6. **Free Grace Perspective**
   - Salvation terminology rendered to support Free Grace soteriology
   - Clear distinction between faith and works maintained
   - Eternal security implications preserved in translation choices

7. **Dispensationalist Framework**
   - Prophetic passages interpreted with Dispensationalist eschatology
   - Israel/Church distinction maintained in relevant passages
   - Dispensational transitions clearly marked

### Scholarly Standards

8. **Source Text Fidelity**
   - Westminster Leningrad Codex (WLC) for Hebrew Old Testament
   - SBL Greek New Testament (SBLGNT) for Greek New Testament
   - Manuscript evidence cited for textual decisions

9. **Transparency**
   - All translation decisions documented
   - Alternative readings provided in footnotes
   - Morphological analysis included for significant terms

### Doctrinal Translation Standards

10. **Salvation Terminology**
    - πίστις/πιστεύω handled case-by-case ("faith/believe" vs "faithfulness/be faithful")
    - "Works" (ἔργα) distinguished from "faith" in context
    - "Justification" vs. "sanctification" vs. "glorification" clearly differentiated
    - Translate literally - don't change text to support theology

11. **Doctrinal Neutrality**
    - No theological footnotes explaining Free Grace positions
    - Let the text speak for itself without interpretive additions
    - Literal translation regardless of theological implications

12. **Israel vs. Church Distinction**
    - "Israel" and "Church" (ἐκκλησία) never conflated or substituted
    - Covenant language preserved to maintain dispensational distinctions
    - Prophetic passages maintain literal Israel references

### Textual and Manuscript Standards

13. **Manuscript Preference**
    - SBL critical text used as primary basis for New Testament
    - Latest scholarly consensus preferred over historically used texts
    - No apparatus notes for variant readings - stick with scholarly consensus

14. **Gender and Pronouns**
    - Generic masculine maintained where original text uses it
    - No gender-neutral language - maintain original patterns
    - Never capitalize deity references (god, holy spirit) - follow original manuscripts
    - Deity pronouns not capitalized
    - ἀδελφοί = "brothers" (not "brothers and sisters")
    - ἄνθρωπος/אדם = "man/mankind" (not "people/humanity")

### Consistency Requirements

15. **Terminological Consistency**
    - Key theological terms translated identically throughout (create glossary)
    - Proper nouns standardized across all books
    - Measurements converted with footnotes explaining originals

16. **Eschatological Terms**
    - "Kingdom" terminology preserved to maintain dispensational framework
    - Rapture-related passages translated to support pre-tribulation view
    - Millennial passages rendered literally, not allegorically

17. **Cross-Reference Standards**
    - Include cross-references supporting Free Grace distinctives
    - Reference parallel dispensational passages
    - Note fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies

### Quality Control Standards

18. **Review Process**
    - All translation choices reviewed for doctrinal consistency
    - Grammar and style checked by qualified editors
    - Theological review by Free Grace scholars for key passages

19. **Cultural Sensitivity**
    - Ancient cultural practices explained in footnotes, not modernized
    - Monetary/measurement references kept with explanatory footnotes
    - Idioms explained rather than replaced with modern equivalents

### Hebrew and Greek Linguistic Standards

    - Works of the Law vs. good works carefully differentiated
    - Mosaic Law vs. principles clearly distinguished

23. **Flesh vs. Spirit Terminology**
    - "Flesh" (σάρξ) consistently rendered to avoid confusion with physicality

    - Hebrew poetry formatted to show parallelism

    - Old Testament quotes in New Testament marked clearly
    - Allusions to OT noted in cross-references
    - Quotations within quotations properly formatted

    - Church government terms handled case-by-case
    - No blanket rules for denominationally sensitive passages
    - Let context determine specific word choices
