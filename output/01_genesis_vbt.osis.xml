        <title type="chapter">Chapter 1</title>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.1">In the beginning, God created the sky and the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.2">The earth was formless and empty, with darkness covering the surface of the deep waters. God's spirit moved over the water's surface.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.3">God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.4">God saw that the light was good, so he separated the light from the darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.5">God called the light "day" and the darkness "night." Evening came, then morning came—the first day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.6">God said, "Let there be a dome in the middle of the water to separate water from water."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.7">So God made the dome and separated the water below the dome from the water above the dome. It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.8">God called the dome "sky." Evening came, then morning came—the second day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.9">God said, "Let the water under the sky gather into one place so the dry ground appears." It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.10">God called the dry ground "land" and the gathered water "seas." God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.11">God said, "Let the land produce vegetation: plants that make seeds and trees that bear fruit with seeds inside, each producing offspring like itself." It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.12">The land produced vegetation: plants that make seeds like themselves and trees that bear fruit with seeds inside like themselves. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.13">Evening came, then morning came—the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.14">God said, "Let there be lights in the sky to separate day from night. They will serve as signs to mark the seasons, days, and years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.15">They will be lights in the sky to shine on the earth." It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.16">God made two great lights: the larger light to rule the day and the smaller light to rule the night. He also made the stars.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.17">God placed them in the sky to shine on the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.18">to rule over day and night, and to separate light from darkness. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.19">Evening came, then morning came—the fourth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.20">God said, "Let the water swarm with living creatures and let birds fly above the earth across the sky."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.21">God created the great sea creatures and every living thing that moves through the water in swarms, each producing offspring like itself. He also created every bird with wings, each producing offspring like itself. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.22">God blessed them, saying, "Have many offspring and fill the water in the seas. Let the birds multiply on the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.23">Evening came, then morning came—the fifth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.24">God said, "Let the land produce living creatures, each producing offspring like itself: livestock, small animals, and wild animals." It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.25">God made the wild animals, livestock, and all the small animals that move along the ground, each producing offspring like itself. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.26">God said, "Let us make humans in our image, to be like us. They will rule over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the livestock, all the wild animals on earth, and the small animals that scurry along the ground."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.27">So God created humans in his own image. In the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.28">God blessed them and said to them, "Have many children and fill the earth. Take charge of it. Rule over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, and all the animals that move along the ground."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.29">God said, "Pay attention! I have given you every plant that produces seeds on the entire earth and every tree that has fruit with seeds. This will be your food.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.30">And to all the wild animals, all the birds in the sky, and all the small animals that scurry along the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I have given every green plant as food." It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.31">God looked at everything he had made, and he saw that it was very good. Evening came, then morning came—the sixth day.</verse>
