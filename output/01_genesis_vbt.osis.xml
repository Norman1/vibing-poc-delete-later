      <chapter osisID="Gen.1">
        <title type="chapter">Chapter 1</title>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.1">In the beginning, God created the sky and the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.2">The earth was formless and empty, with darkness covering the surface of the deep waters. God's spirit moved over the water's surface.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.3">God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.4">God saw that the light was good, so he separated the light from the darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.5">God called the light "day" and the darkness "night." Evening came, then morning came—the first day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.6">God said, "Let there be a dome in the middle of the water to separate water from water."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.7">So God made the dome and separated the water below the dome from the water above the dome. It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.8">God called the dome "sky." Evening came, then morning came—the second day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.9">God said, "Let the water under the sky gather into one place so the dry ground appears." It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.10">God called the dry ground "land" and the gathered water "seas." God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.11">God said, "Let the land produce vegetation: plants that make seeds and trees that bear fruit with seeds inside, each producing offspring like itself." It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.12">The land produced vegetation: plants that make seeds like themselves and trees that bear fruit with seeds inside like themselves. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.13">Evening came, then morning came—the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.14">God said, "Let there be lights in the sky to separate day from night. They will serve as signs to mark the seasons, days, and years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.15">They will be lights in the sky to shine on the earth." It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.16">God made two great lights: the larger light to rule the day and the smaller light to rule the night. He also made the stars.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.17">God placed them in the sky to shine on the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.18">to rule over day and night, and to separate light from darkness. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.19">Evening came, then morning came—the fourth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.20">God said, "Let the water swarm with living creatures and let birds fly above the earth across the sky."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.21">God created the great sea creatures and every living thing that moves through the water in swarms, each producing offspring like itself. He also created every bird with wings, each producing offspring like itself. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.22">God blessed them, saying, "Have many offspring and fill the water in the seas. Let the birds multiply on the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.23">Evening came, then morning came—the fifth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.24">God said, "Let the land produce living creatures, each producing offspring like itself: livestock, small animals, and wild animals." It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.25">God made the wild animals, livestock, and all the small animals that move along the ground, each producing offspring like itself. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.26">God said, "Let us make humans in our image, to be like us. They will rule over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the livestock, all the wild animals on earth, and the small animals that scurry along the ground."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.27">So God created humans in his own image. In the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.28">God blessed them and said to them, "Have many children and fill the earth. Take charge of it. Rule over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, and all the animals that move along the ground."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.29">God said, "Pay attention! I have given you every plant that produces seeds on the entire earth and every tree that has fruit with seeds. This will be your food.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.30">And to all the wild animals, all the birds in the sky, and all the small animals that scurry along the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I have given every green plant as food." It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.31">God looked at everything he had made, and he saw that it was very good. Evening came, then morning came—the sixth day.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Gen.2">
        <title type="chapter">Chapter 2</title>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.1">So the sky and earth were finished, along with everything in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.2">By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing, so on the seventh day he rested from all his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.3">God blessed the seventh day and set it apart as something special because on that day he rested from all the creative work he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.4">This is the account of the sky and earth when they were created, when Yahweh God made the earth and sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.5">No wild plants had yet appeared on the earth, and no crops had begun to grow, because Yahweh God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no one to work the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.6">Instead, water would come up from the earth and water the entire surface of the ground.<note type="translation">Hebrew 'ed can mean mist, stream, or spring</note></verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.7">Then Yahweh God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.8">Now Yahweh God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden, and there he put the man he had formed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.9">Yahweh God made all kinds of trees grow from the ground—trees that were beautiful to look at and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.10">A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was divided into four smaller rivers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.11">The name of the first is Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.12">The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin and precious stones are also there.<note type="translation">Hebrew 'bdolach and 'shoham refer to valuable materials, possibly pearls/resin and onyx</note></verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.13">The name of the second river is Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.14">The name of the third river is Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.15">Yahweh God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.16">And Yahweh God commanded the man, "You are free to eat from every tree in the garden;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.17">but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.18">Yahweh God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.19">Now Yahweh God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.20">So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals. But for Adam no suitable helper was found.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.21">So Yahweh God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs and then closed up the place with flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.22">Then Yahweh God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.23">The man said, "This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'woman,' because she was taken out of man."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.24">That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.25">Adam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Gen.3">
        <title type="chapter">Chapter 3</title>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.1">Now the serpent was more cunning than any of the wild animals Yahweh God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God really say, 'You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.2">The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.3">but God did say, 'You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.4">"You will not certainly die," the serpent said to the woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.5">"For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.6">When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eyes, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.7">Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.8">Then the man and his wife heard the sound of Yahweh God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from Yahweh God among the trees of the garden.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.9">But Yahweh God called to the man, "Where are you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.10">He answered, "I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.11">And he said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.12">The man said, "The woman you put here with me—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.13">Then Yahweh God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?" The woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.14">So Yahweh God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and all wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.15">And I will put hostility between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.16">To the woman he said, "I will make your pains in childbearing very severe; with painful labor you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.17">To Adam he said, "Because you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I commanded you, 'You must not eat from it,' cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.18">It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.19">By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.20">Adam named his wife Eve, because she would become the mother of all the living.<note type="translation">Hebrew 'Havvah sounds like the Hebrew for 'living'</note></verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.21">Yahweh God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.22">And Yahweh God said, "The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.23">So Yahweh God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.24">After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Gen.4">
        <title type="chapter">Chapter 4</title>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.1">Adam made love to his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said, "With Yahweh's help, I have brought forth a man."<note type="translation">Hebrew 'qaniti sounds like the name Cain</note></verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.2">Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.3">In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.4">And Abel also brought an offering—fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. Yahweh looked with favor on Abel and his offering,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.5">but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.6">Then Yahweh said to Cain, "Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.7">If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.8">Now Cain said to his brother Abel, "Let's go out to the field." While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.9">Then Yahweh said to Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" "I don't know," he replied. "Am I my brother's keeper?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.10">Yahweh said, "What have you done? Listen! Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.11">Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.12">When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.13">Cain said to Yahweh, "My punishment is more than I can bear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.14">Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.15">But Yahweh said to him, "Not so; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over." Then Yahweh put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.16">So Cain went out from Yahweh's presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.17">Cain made love to his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.18">To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.19">Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.20">Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.21">His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play the harp and flute.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.22">Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain's sister was Naamah.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.23">Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.24">If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.25">Adam made love to his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, "God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.26">Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to call on the name of Yahweh.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Gen.6">
        <title type="chapter">Chapter 6</title>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.1">When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.2">the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.3">Then Yahweh said, "My Spirit will not contend with humans forever, for they are mortal; their days will be a hundred and twenty years."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.4">The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.5">Yahweh saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.6">Yahweh regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.7">So Yahweh said, "I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created—and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground—for I regret that I have made them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.8">But Noah found favor in the eyes of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.9">This is the account of Noah and his family. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.10">Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.11">Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight and was full of violence.</verse>
