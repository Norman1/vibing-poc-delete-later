      <chapter osisID="Gen.1">
        <title type="chapter">Chapter 1</title>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.1">In the beginning, God created the sky and the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.2">The earth was formless and empty, with darkness covering the surface of the deep waters. God's spirit moved over the water's surface.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.3">God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.4">God saw that the light was good, so he separated the light from the darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.5">God called the light "day" and the darkness "night." Evening came, then morning came—the first day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.6">God said, "Let there be a dome in the middle of the water to separate water from water."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.7">So God made the dome and separated the water below the dome from the water above the dome. It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.8">God called the dome "sky." Evening came, then morning came—the second day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.9">God said, "Let the water under the sky gather into one place so the dry ground appears." It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.10">God called the dry ground "land" and the gathered water "seas." God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.11">God said, "Let the land produce vegetation: plants that make seeds and trees that bear fruit with seeds inside, each producing offspring like itself." It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.12">The land produced vegetation: plants that make seeds like themselves and trees that bear fruit with seeds inside like themselves. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.13">Evening came, then morning came—the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.14">God said, "Let there be lights in the sky to separate day from night. They will serve as signs to mark the seasons, days, and years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.15">They will be lights in the sky to shine on the earth." It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.16">God made two great lights: the larger light to rule the day and the smaller light to rule the night. He also made the stars.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.17">God placed them in the sky to shine on the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.18">to rule over day and night, and to separate light from darkness. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.19">Evening came, then morning came—the fourth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.20">God said, "Let the water swarm with living creatures and let birds fly above the earth across the sky."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.21">God created the great sea creatures and every living thing that moves through the water in swarms, each producing offspring like itself. He also created every bird with wings, each producing offspring like itself. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.22">God blessed them, saying, "Have many offspring and fill the water in the seas. Let the birds multiply on the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.23">Evening came, then morning came—the fifth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.24">God said, "Let the land produce living creatures, each producing offspring like itself: livestock, small animals, and wild animals." It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.25">God made the wild animals, livestock, and all the small animals that move along the ground, each producing offspring like itself. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.26">God said, "Let us make humans in our image, to be like us. They will rule over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the livestock, all the wild animals on earth, and the small animals that scurry along the ground."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.27">So God created humans in his own image. In the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.28">God blessed them and said to them, "Have many children and fill the earth. Take charge of it. Rule over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, and all the animals that move along the ground."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.29">God said, "Pay attention! I have given you every plant that produces seeds on the entire earth and every tree that has fruit with seeds. This will be your food.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.30">And to all the wild animals, all the birds in the sky, and all the small animals that scurry along the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I have given every green plant as food." It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.31">God looked at everything he had made, and he saw that it was very good. Evening came, then morning came—the sixth day.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Gen.2">
        <title type="chapter">Chapter 2</title>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.1">So the sky and earth were finished, along with everything in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.2">By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing, so on the seventh day he rested from all his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.3">God blessed the seventh day and set it apart as something special because on that day he rested from all the creative work he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.4">This is the account of the sky and earth when they were created, when Yahweh God made the earth and sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.5">No wild plants had yet appeared on the earth, and no crops had begun to grow, because Yahweh God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no one to work the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.6">Instead, water would come up from the earth and water the entire surface of the ground.<note type="translation">Hebrew 'ed can mean mist, stream, or spring</note></verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.7">Then Yahweh God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.8">Now Yahweh God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden, and there he put the man he had formed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.9">Yahweh God made all kinds of trees grow from the ground—trees that were beautiful to look at and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.10">A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was divided into four smaller rivers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.11">The name of the first is Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.12">The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin and precious stones are also there.<note type="translation">Hebrew 'bdolach and 'shoham refer to valuable materials, possibly pearls/resin and onyx</note></verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.13">The name of the second river is Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.14">The name of the third river is Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.15">Yahweh God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.16">And Yahweh God commanded the man, "You are free to eat from every tree in the garden;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.17">but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.18">Yahweh God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.19">Now Yahweh God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.20">So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals. But for Adam no suitable helper was found.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.21">So Yahweh God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs and then closed up the place with flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.22">Then Yahweh God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.23">The man said, "This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'woman,' because she was taken out of man."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.24">That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.25">Adam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Gen.3">
        <title type="chapter">Chapter 3</title>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.1">Now the serpent was more cunning than any of the wild animals Yahweh God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God really say, 'You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.2">The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.3">but God did say, 'You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.4">"You will not certainly die," the serpent said to the woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.5">"For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.6">When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eyes, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.7">Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.8">Then the man and his wife heard the sound of Yahweh God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from Yahweh God among the trees of the garden.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.9">But Yahweh God called to the man, "Where are you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.10">He answered, "I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.11">And he said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.12">The man said, "The woman you put here with me—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.13">Then Yahweh God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?" The woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.14">So Yahweh God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and all wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.15">And I will put hostility between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.16">To the woman he said, "I will make your pains in childbearing very severe; with painful labor you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.17">To Adam he said, "Because you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I commanded you, 'You must not eat from it,' cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.18">It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.19">By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.20">Adam named his wife Eve, because she would become the mother of all the living.<note type="translation">Hebrew 'Havvah sounds like the Hebrew for 'living'</note></verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.21">Yahweh God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.22">And Yahweh God said, "The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.23">So Yahweh God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.24">After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Gen.4">
        <title type="chapter">Chapter 4</title>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.1">Adam made love to his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said, "With Yahweh's help, I have brought forth a man."<note type="translation">Hebrew 'qaniti sounds like the name Cain</note></verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.2">Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.3">In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.4">And Abel also brought an offering—fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. Yahweh looked with favor on Abel and his offering,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.5">but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.6">Then Yahweh said to Cain, "Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.7">If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.8">Now Cain said to his brother Abel, "Let's go out to the field." While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.9">Then Yahweh said to Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" "I don't know," he replied. "Am I my brother's keeper?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.10">Yahweh said, "What have you done? Listen! Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.11">Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.12">When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.13">Cain said to Yahweh, "My punishment is more than I can bear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.14">Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.15">But Yahweh said to him, "Not so; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over." Then Yahweh put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.16">So Cain went out from Yahweh's presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.17">Cain made love to his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.18">To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.19">Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.20">Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.21">His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play the harp and flute.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.22">Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain's sister was Naamah.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.23">Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.24">If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.25">Adam made love to his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, "God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.26">Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to call on the name of Yahweh.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Gen.6">
        <title type="chapter">Chapter 6</title>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.1">When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.2">the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.3">Then Yahweh said, "My Spirit will not contend with humans forever, for they are mortal; their days will be a hundred and twenty years."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.4">The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.5">Yahweh saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.6">Yahweh regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.7">So Yahweh said, "I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created—and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground—for I regret that I have made them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.8">But Noah found favor in the eyes of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.9">This is the account of Noah and his family. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.8.2">Now the springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens had been closed, and the rain had stopped falling from the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.8.3">The water receded steadily from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.8.8">Then he sent out a dove to see if the water had receded from the surface of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.8.9">But the dove could find nowhere to perch because there was water over all the surface of the earth; so it returned to Noah in the ark. He reached out his hand and took the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.8.10">He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.8.11">When the dove returned to him in the evening, there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.8.13">By the first day of the first month of Noah's six hundred and first year, the water had dried up from the earth. Noah then removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.8.14">By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.8.21">Yahweh smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart: "Never again will I curse the ground because of humans, even though every inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood. And never again will I destroy all living creatures, as I have done.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.12.8">From there he went on toward the hills east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to Yahweh and called on the name of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.12.9">Then Abram set out and continued toward the Negev.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.12.10">Now there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while because the famine was severe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.12.11">As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, "I know what a beautiful woman you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.12.12">When the Egyptians see you, they will say, 'This is his wife.' Then they will kill me but will let you live.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.12.13">Say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.12.14">When Abram came to Egypt, the Egyptians saw that Sarai was a very beautiful woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.12.15">And when Pharaoh's officials saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into his palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.12.16">He treated Abram well for her sake, and Abram acquired sheep and cattle, male and female donkeys, male and female servants, and camels.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.12.17">But Yahweh inflicted serious diseases on Pharaoh and his household because of Abram's wife Sarai.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.12.18">So Pharaoh summoned Abram. "What have you done to me?" he said. "Why didn't you tell me she was your wife?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.12.19">Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her to be my wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her and go!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.12.20">Then Pharaoh gave orders about Abram to his men, and they sent him on his way, with his wife and everything he had.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.13.2">Abram had become very wealthy in livestock and in silver and gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.3">From the Negev he went from place to place until he came to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had been earlier</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.4">and where he had first built an altar. There Abram called on the name of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.5">Now Lot, who was moving about with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.6">But the land could not support them while they stayed together, for their possessions were so great that they were not able to stay together.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.7">And quarreling arose between Abram's herders and Lot's. The Canaanites and Perizzites were also living in the land at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.8">So Abram said to Lot, "Let's not have any quarreling between you and me, or between your herders and mine, for we are close relatives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.9">Is not the whole land before you? Let's part company. If you go to the left, I'll go to the right; if you go to the right, I'll go to the left."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.10">Lot looked around and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan toward Zoar was well watered, like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt. (This was before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.11">So Lot chose for himself the whole plain of the Jordan and set out toward the east. The two men parted company:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.12">Abram lived in the land of Canaan, while Lot lived among the cities of the plain and pitched his tents near Sodom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.13">Now the people of Sodom were wicked and were sinning greatly against Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.14">Yahweh said to Abram after Lot had parted from him, "Look around from where you are, to the north and south, to the east and west.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.15">All the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring forever.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.14.5">In the fourteenth year, Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him went out and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, the Emites in Shaveh Kiriathaim</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.15.5">He took him outside and said, "Look up at the sky and count the stars—if indeed you can count them." Then he said to him, "So shall your offspring be."</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.15.10">Abram brought all these to him, cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other; the birds, however, he did not cut in half.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.15.11">Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.15.12">As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.15.13">Then Yahweh said to him, "Know for certain that for four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own and that they will be enslaved and mistreated there.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.16.2">so she said to Abram, "Yahweh has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my slave; perhaps I can build a family through her." Abram agreed to what Sarai said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.16.3">So after Abram had been living in Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took her Egyptian slave Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.16.4">He slept with Hagar, and she conceived. When she knew she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.16.5">Then Sarai said to Abram, "You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my slave in your arms, and now that she knows she is pregnant, she despises me. May Yahweh judge between you and me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.16.6">"Your slave is in your hands," Abram said. "Do with her whatever you think best." Then Sarai mistreated Hagar; so she fled from her.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.16.8">And he said, "Hagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?" "I'm running away from my mistress Sarai," she answered.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.16.11">The angel of Yahweh also said to her: "You are now pregnant and you will give birth to a son. You shall name him Ishmael, for Yahweh has heard of your misery.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.16.12">He will be a wild donkey of a man; his hand will be against everyone and everyone's hand against him, and he will live in hostility toward all his brothers."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.16.13">She gave this name to Yahweh who spoke to her: "You are the God who sees me," for she said, "I have now seen the One who sees me."</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.18.2">Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby. When he saw them, he hurried from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.18.3">He said, "If I have found favor in your eyes, my lord, do not pass your servant by.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.18.4">Let a little water be brought, and then you may all wash your feet and rest under this tree.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.18.6">So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah. "Quick," he said, "get three seahs of the finest flour and knead it and bake some bread."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.18.7">Then he ran to the herd and selected a choice, tender calf and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.18.8">He then brought some curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared, and set these before them. While they ate, he stood near them under a tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.18.9">"Where is your wife Sarah?" they asked him. "There, in the tent," he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.18.10">Then one of them said, "I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife will have a son." Now Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent, which was behind him.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.18.20">Then Yahweh said, "The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.18.25">Far be it from you to do such a thing—to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?"</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.18.29">Once again he spoke to him, "What if only forty are found there?" He said, "For the sake of forty, I will not do it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.18.30">Then he said, "May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak. What if only thirty can be found there?" He answered, "I will not do it if I find thirty there."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.18.31">Abraham said, "Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, what if only twenty can be found there?" He said, "For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.18.32">Then he said, "May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak just once more. What if only ten can be found there?" He answered, "For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.18.33">When Yahweh had finished speaking with Abraham, he left, and Abraham returned home.</verse>

        <title type="chapter">Chapter 19</title>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.1">The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.2">"My lords," he said, "please turn aside to your servant's house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning." "No," they answered, "we will spend the night in the square."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.3">But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.4">Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom—both young and old—surrounded the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.5">They called to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.6">Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.7">and said, "No, my friends. Don't do this wicked thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.8">Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don't do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.9">"Get out of our way," they replied. "This fellow came here as a foreigner, and now he wants to play the judge! We'll treat you worse than them." They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.10">But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.11">Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.12">The two men said to Lot, "Do you have anyone else here—sons-in-law, sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.13">because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to Yahweh against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.14">So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters. He said, "Hurry and get out of this place, because Yahweh is about to destroy the city!" But his sons-in-law thought he was joking.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.15">With the coming of dawn, the angels urged Lot, saying, "Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away when the city is punished."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.16">When he hesitated, the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city, for Yahweh was merciful to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.17">As soon as they had brought them out, one of them said, "Flee for your lives! Don't look back, and don't stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.18">But Lot said to them, "No, my lords, please!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.19">Your servant has found favor in your eyes, and you have shown great kindness to me in sparing my life. But I can't flee to the mountains; this disaster will overtake me, and I'll die.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.20">Look, here is a town near enough to run to, and it is small. Let me flee to it—it is very small, isn't it? Then my life will be spared."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.21">He said to him, "Very well, I will grant this request too; I will not overthrow the town you speak of.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.22">But flee there quickly, because I cannot do anything until you reach it." (That is why the town was called Zoar.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.23">By the time Lot reached Zoar, the sun had risen over the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.24">Then Yahweh rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah—from Yahweh out of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.25">Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, destroying all those living in the cities—and also the vegetation in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.26">But Lot's wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.27">Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.28">He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.29">So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.30">Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.31">One day the older daughter said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is no man around here to give us children—as is the custom all over the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.32">Let's get our father to drink wine and then sleep with him and preserve our family line through our father."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.33">That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and slept with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.34">The next day the older daughter said to the younger, "Last night I slept with my father. Let's get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and sleep with him so we can preserve our family line through our father."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.35">So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went in and slept with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.36">So both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.37">The older daughter had a son, and she named him Moab; he is the father of the Moabites of today.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.19.38">The younger daughter also had a son, and she named him Ben-Ammi; he is the father of the Ammonites of today.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Gen.20" sID="Gen.20"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.20.1">From there Abraham journeyed toward the region of the Negev and lived between Kadesh and Shur. For a while he stayed in Gerar,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.20.2">and there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, "She is my sister." Then Abimelech king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.20.3">But God came to Abimelech in a dream one night and said to him, "You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.20.4">Now Abimelech had not gone near her, so he said, "Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.20.5">Did he not say to me, 'She is my sister,' and didn't she also say, 'He is my brother'? I have done this with a clear conscience and clean hands."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.20.6">Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.20.7">Now return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return her, you may be sure that you and all who belong to you will die."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.20.8">Early the next morning Abimelech summoned all his officials, and when he told them all that had happened, they were very much afraid.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.20.9">Then Abimelech called Abraham in and said, "What have you done to us? How have I wronged you that you have brought such great guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should never be done."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.20.10">And Abimelech asked Abraham, "What was your reason for doing this?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.20.11">Abraham replied, "I said to myself, 'There is surely no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.20.12">Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not of my mother; and she became my wife.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.20.13">And when God had me wander from my father's household, I said to her, 'This is how you can show your love to me: Everywhere we go, say of me, "He is my brother."'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.20.14">Then Abimelech brought sheep and cattle and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham, and he returned Sarah his wife to him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.20.15">And Abimelech said, "My land is before you; live wherever you like."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.20.16">To Sarah he said, "I am giving your brother a thousand shekels of silver. This is to cover the offense against you before all who are with you; you are completely vindicated."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.20.17">Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife and his female slaves so they could have children again,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.20.18">for Yahweh had kept all the women in Abimelech's household from conceiving because of Abraham's wife Sarah.</verse>

      <!-- Chapter 21: Birth of Isaac and banishment of Hagar -->
      <chapter osisID="Gen.21" sID="Gen.21"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.1">Yahweh was gracious to Sarah as he had said, and Yahweh did for Sarah what he had promised.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.2">Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.3">Abraham gave the name Isaac to the son Sarah bore him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.4">When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God commanded him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.5">Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.6">Sarah said, "God has brought me laughter, and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.7">And she added, "Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.8">The child grew and was weaned, and on the day Isaac was weaned Abraham held a great feast.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.9">But Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was mocking,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.10">and she said to Abraham, "Get rid of that slave woman and her son, for that woman's son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.11">The matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.12">But God said to him, "Do not be so distressed about the boy and your slave woman. Listen to whatever Sarah tells you, because it is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.13">I will make the son of the slave into a nation also, because he is your offspring."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.14">Early the next morning Abraham took some food and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar. He set them on her shoulders and then sent her off with the boy. She went on her way and wandered in the Desert of Beersheba.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.15">When the water in the skin was gone, she put the boy under one of the bushes.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.16">Then she went off and sat down about a bowshot away, for she thought, "I cannot watch the boy die." And as she sat there, she began to sob.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.17">God heard the boy crying, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, "What is the matter, Hagar? Do not be afraid; God has heard the boy crying as he lies there.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.18">Lift the boy up and take him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.19">Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.20">God was with the boy as he grew up. He lived in the desert and became an archer.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.21">While he was living in the Desert of Paran, his mother got a wife for him from Egypt.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.22">At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his forces said to Abraham, "God is with you in everything you do.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.23">Now swear to me here before God that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or my descendants. Show to me and the country where you now reside as a foreigner the same kindness I have shown to you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.24">Abraham said, "I swear it."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.25">Then Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech's servants had seized.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.26">But Abimelech said, "I don't know who has done this. You did not tell me, and I heard about it only today."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.27">So Abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a treaty.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.28">Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs from the flock,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.29">and Abimelech asked Abraham, "What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs you have set apart by themselves?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.30">He replied, "Accept these seven lambs from my hand as a witness that I dug this well."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.31">So that place was called Beersheba, because the two men swore an oath there.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.32">After the treaty had been made at Beersheba, Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his forces returned to the land of the Philistines.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.33">Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called on the name of Yahweh, the Eternal God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.21.34">And Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines for a long time.</verse>
      <chapter eID="Gen.21"/>
      <!-- Chapter 22: Abraham's test with Isaac -->
      <chapter osisID="Gen.22" sID="Gen.22"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.22.1">Some time later God tested Abraham. He said to him, "Abraham!" "Here I am," he replied.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.22.2">Then God said, "Take your son, your only son, whom you love—Isaac—and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.22.3">Early the next morning Abraham got up and loaded his donkey. He took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac. When he had cut enough wood for the burnt offering, he set out for the place God had told him about.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.22.4">On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.22.5">He said to his servants, "Stay here with the donkey while I and the boy go over there. We will worship and then we will come back to you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.22.6">Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them went on together,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.22.7">Isaac spoke up and said to his father Abraham, "Father?" "Yes, my son?" Abraham replied. "The fire and wood are here," Isaac said, "but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.22.8">Abraham answered, "God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son." And the two of them went on together.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.22.9">When they reached the place God had told him about, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.22.10">Then he reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.22.11">But the angel of Yahweh called out to him from heaven, "Abraham! Abraham!" "Here I am," he replied.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.22.12">"Do not lay a hand on the boy," he said. "Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.22.13">Abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a ram caught by its horns. He went over and took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.22.14">So Abraham called that place Yahweh Will Provide. And to this day it is said, "On the mountain of Yahweh it will be provided."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.22.15">The angel of Yahweh called to Abraham from heaven a second time</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.22.16">and said, "I swear by myself, declares Yahweh, that because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.22.17">I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of the cities of their enemies,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.22.18">and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.22.19">Then Abraham returned to his servants, and they set off together for Beersheba. And Abraham stayed in Beersheba.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.22.20">Some time later Abraham was told, "Milkah is also a mother; she has borne sons to your brother Nahor:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.22.21">Uz the firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel (the father of Aram),</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.22.22">Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph and Bethuel."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.22.23">Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. Milkah bore these eight sons to Abraham's brother Nahor.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.22.24">His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also had sons: Tebah, Gaham, Tahash and Maakah.</verse>

      <!-- Chapter 23: Death of Sarah -->
      <chapter osisID="Gen.23" sID="Gen.23"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.23.1">Sarah lived to be a hundred and twenty-seven years old.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.23.2">She died at Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep over her.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.23.3">Then Abraham rose from beside his dead wife and spoke to the Hittites. He said,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.23.4">"I am a foreigner and stranger among you. Sell me some property for a burial site here so I can bury my dead."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.23.5">The Hittites replied to Abraham,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.23.6">"Sir, listen to us. You are a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will refuse you his tomb for burying your dead."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.23.7">Then Abraham rose and bowed down before the people of the land, the Hittites.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.23.8">He said to them, "If you are willing to let me bury my dead, then listen to me and intercede with Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.23.9">so he will sell me the cave of Machpelah, which belongs to him and is at the end of his field. Ask him to sell it to me for the full price as a burial site among you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.23.10">Ephron the Hittite was sitting among his people and he replied to Abraham in the hearing of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.23.11">"No, my lord," he said. "Listen to me; I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. I give it to you in the presence of my people. Bury your dead."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.23.12">Again Abraham bowed down before the people of the land</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.23.13">and he said to Ephron in their hearing, "Listen to me, if you will. I will pay the price of the field. Accept it from me so I can bury my dead there."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.23.14">Ephron answered Abraham,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.23.15">"Listen to me, my lord; the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver, but what is that between you and me? Bury your dead."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.23.16">Abraham agreed to Ephron's terms and weighed out for him the price he had named in the hearing of the Hittites: four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weight current among the merchants.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.23.17">So Ephron's field in Machpelah near Mamre—both the field and the cave in it, and all the trees within the borders of the field—was deeded</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.23.18">to Abraham as his property in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of the city.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.23.19">Afterward Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre (which is at Hebron) in the land of Canaan.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.23.20">So the field and the cave in it were deeded to Abraham by the Hittites as a burial site.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Gen.24.1">Abraham was now very old, and Yahweh had blessed him in every way.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.2">He said to the senior servant in his household, the one in charge of all that he had, "Put your hand under my thigh.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Gen.24.8">If the woman is unwilling to come back with you, then you will be released from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.9">So the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.10">Then the servant left, taking with him ten of his master's camels loaded with all kinds of good things from his master. He set out for Aram Naharaim and made his way to the town of Nahor.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.11">He had the camels kneel down near the well outside the town; it was toward evening, the time the women go out to draw water.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.12">Then he prayed, "Yahweh, God of my master Abraham, make me successful today, and show kindness to my master Abraham.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.13">See, I am standing beside this spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.14">May it be that when I say to a young woman, 'Please let down your jar that I may have a drink,' and she says, 'Drink, and I'll water your camels too'—let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.15">Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milkah, who was the wife of Abraham's brother Nahor.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.16">The woman was very beautiful, a virgin; no man had ever slept with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar and came up again.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.17">The servant hurried to meet her and said, "Please give me a little water from your jar."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.18">"Drink, my lord," she said, and quickly lowered the jar to her hands and gave him a drink.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.19">After she had given him a drink, she said, "I'll draw water for your camels too, until they have had enough to drink."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.20">So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, ran back to the well to draw more water, and drew enough for all his camels.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.21">Without saying a word, the man watched her closely to learn whether or not Yahweh had made his journey successful.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.22">When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a beka and two gold bracelets weighing ten shekels.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.23">Then he asked, "Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father's house for us to spend the night?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.24">She answered him, "I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milkah bore to Nahor."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.25">And she added, "We have plenty of straw and fodder, as well as room for you to spend the night."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.26">Then the man bowed down and worshiped Yahweh,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.27">saying, "Praise be to Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master. As for me, Yahweh has led me on the journey to the house of my master's relatives."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.28">The young woman ran and told her mother's household about these things.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.29">Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he hurried out to the man at the spring.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.30">As soon as he had seen the nose ring, and the bracelets on his sister's arms, and had heard Rebekah tell what the man said to her, he went out to the man and found him standing by the camels near the spring.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.31">"Come, you who are blessed by Yahweh," he said. "Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.32">So the man went to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and fodder were brought for the camels, and water for him and his men to wash their feet.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.33">Then food was set before him, but he said, "I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say." "Then tell us," Laban said.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.34">So he said, "I am Abraham's servant.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.35">Yahweh has blessed my master abundantly, and he has become wealthy. He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male and female servants, and camels and donkeys.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.36">My master's wife Sarah has borne him a son in her old age, and he has given him everything he owns.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.37">And my master made me swear an oath, and said, 'You must not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.38">but go to my father's family and to my own clan, and get a wife for my son.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.39">"Then I asked my master, 'What if the woman will not come back with me?'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.40">"He replied, 'Yahweh, before whom I have walked faithfully, will send his angel with you and make your journey a success, so that you can get a wife for my son from my own clan and from my father's family.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.41">You will be released from my oath if, when you go to my clan, they refuse to give her to you—then you will be released from my oath.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.42">"When I came to the spring today, I said, 'Yahweh, God of my master Abraham, if you will, please grant success to the journey on which I have come.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.43">See, I am standing beside this spring. If a young woman comes out to draw water and I say to her, "Please let me drink a little water from your jar,"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.44">and if she says to me, "Drink, and I'll draw water for your camels too," let her be the one Yahweh has chosen for my master's son.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.45">"Before I finished praying in my heart, Rebekah came out, with her jar on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew water, and I said to her, 'Please give me a drink.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.46">"She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, 'Drink, and I'll water your camels too.' So I drank, and she watered the camels also.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.47">"I asked her, 'Whose daughter are you?' "She said, 'The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milkah bore to him.' "Then I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.48">and I bowed down and worshiped Yahweh. I praised Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me on the right road to get the granddaughter of my master's brother for his son.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.49">Now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, so I may know which way to turn."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.50">Laban and Bethuel answered, "This is from Yahweh; we can say nothing to you one way or the other.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.51">Here is Rebekah; take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master's son, as Yahweh has directed."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.52">When Abraham's servant heard what they said, he bowed down to the ground before Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.53">Then the servant brought out gold and silver jewelry and articles of clothing and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.54">Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night there. When they got up the next morning, he said, "Send me on my way to my master."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.55">But her brother and her mother replied, "Let the young woman remain with us ten days or so; then you may go."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.56">But he said to them, "Do not detain me, now that Yahweh has granted success to my journey. Send me on my way so I may go to my master."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.57">Then they said, "Let's call the young woman and ask her about it."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.58">So they called Rebekah and asked her, "Will you go with this man?" "I will go," she said.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.59">So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way, along with her nurse and Abraham's servant and his men.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.60">And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, "Our sister, may you increase to thousands upon thousands; may your offspring possess the cities of their enemies."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.61">Then Rebekah and her attendants got ready and mounted the camels and went back with the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.62">Now Isaac had come from Beer Lahai Roi, for he was living in the Negev.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.63">He went out to the field one evening to meditate, and as he looked up, he saw camels approaching.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.64">Rebekah also looked up and saw Isaac. She got down from her camel</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.65">and asked the servant, "Who is that man in the field coming to meet us?" "He is my master," the servant answered. So she took her veil and covered herself.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.66">Then the servant told Isaac all he had done.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.24.67">Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he married Rebekah. So she became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Gen.25.1">Abraham had taken another wife, whose name was Keturah.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.2">She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak and Shuah.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.3">Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan; the descendants of Dedan were the Ashurites, the Letushites and the Leummites.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.4">The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanok, Abida and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.5">Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.6">But while he was still living, he gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.7">Abraham lived a hundred and seventy-five years.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.8">Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, an old man and full of years; and he was gathered to his people.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.9">His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.10">the field Abraham had bought from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.11">After Abraham's death, God blessed his son Isaac, who then lived near Beer Lahai Roi.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.12">This is the account of the family line of Abraham's son Ishmael, whom Sarah's slave, Hagar the Egyptian, bore to Abraham.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.13">These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, listed in the order of their birth: Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.14">Mishma, Dumah, Massa,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.15">Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedemah.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.16">These were the sons of Ishmael, and these are the names of the twelve tribal rulers according to their settlements and camps.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.17">Ishmael lived a hundred and thirty-seven years. He breathed his last and died, and he was gathered to his people.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.18">His descendants settled in the area from Havilah to Shur, near the eastern border of Egypt, as you go toward Ashur. And they lived in hostility toward all the tribes related to them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.19">This is the account of the family line of Abraham's son Isaac. Abraham became the father of Isaac,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.20">and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram and sister of Laban the Aramean.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.21">Isaac prayed to Yahweh on behalf of his wife, because she was childless. Yahweh answered his prayer, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.22">The babies jostled each other within her, and she said, "Why is this happening to me?" So she went to inquire of Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.23">Yahweh said to her, "Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you will be separated; one people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.24">When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.25">The first to come out was red, and his whole body was like a hairy garment; so they named him Esau.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.26">After this, his brother came out, with his hand grasping Esau's heel; so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when Rebekah gave birth to them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.27">The boys grew up, and Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the open country, while Jacob was content to stay at home among the tents.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.28">Isaac, who had a taste for wild game, loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.29">Once when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the open country, famished.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.30">He said to Jacob, "Quick, let me have some of that red stew! I'm famished!" (That is why he was also called Edom.)</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.31">Jacob replied, "First sell me your birthright."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.32">"Look, I am about to die," Esau said. "What good is the birthright to me?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.33">But Jacob said, "Swear to me first." So he swore an oath to him, selling his birthright to Jacob.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Gen.25.34">Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and some lentil stew. He ate and drank, and then got up and left. So Esau despised his birthright.</verse>
