      <chapter osisID="Gen.1">
        <title type="chapter">Chapter 1</title>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.1">In the beginning, God created the sky and the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.2">The earth was formless and empty, with darkness covering the surface of the deep waters. God's spirit moved over the water's surface.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.3">God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.4">God saw that the light was good, so he separated the light from the darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.5">God called the light "day" and the darkness "night." Evening came, then morning came—the first day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.6">God said, "Let there be a dome in the middle of the water to separate water from water."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.7">So God made the dome and separated the water below the dome from the water above the dome. It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.8">God called the dome "sky." Evening came, then morning came—the second day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.9">God said, "Let the water under the sky gather into one place so the dry ground appears." It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.10">God called the dry ground "land" and the gathered water "seas." God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.11">God said, "Let the land produce vegetation: plants that make seeds and trees that bear fruit with seeds inside, each producing offspring like itself." It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.12">The land produced vegetation: plants that make seeds like themselves and trees that bear fruit with seeds inside like themselves. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.13">Evening came, then morning came—the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.14">God said, "Let there be lights in the sky to separate day from night. They will serve as signs to mark the seasons, days, and years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.15">They will be lights in the sky to shine on the earth." It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.16">God made two great lights: the larger light to rule the day and the smaller light to rule the night. He also made the stars.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.17">God placed them in the sky to shine on the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.18">to rule over day and night, and to separate light from darkness. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.19">Evening came, then morning came—the fourth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.20">God said, "Let the water swarm with living creatures and let birds fly above the earth across the sky."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.21">God created the great sea creatures and every living thing that moves through the water in swarms, each producing offspring like itself. He also created every bird with wings, each producing offspring like itself. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.22">God blessed them, saying, "Have many offspring and fill the water in the seas. Let the birds multiply on the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.23">Evening came, then morning came—the fifth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.24">God said, "Let the land produce living creatures, each producing offspring like itself: livestock, small animals, and wild animals." It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.25">God made the wild animals, livestock, and all the small animals that move along the ground, each producing offspring like itself. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.26">God said, "Let us make humans in our image, to be like us. They will rule over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the livestock, all the wild animals on earth, and the small animals that scurry along the ground."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.27">So God created humans in his own image. In the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.28">God blessed them and said to them, "Have many children and fill the earth. Take charge of it. Rule over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, and all the animals that move along the ground."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.29">God said, "Pay attention! I have given you every plant that produces seeds on the entire earth and every tree that has fruit with seeds. This will be your food.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.30">And to all the wild animals, all the birds in the sky, and all the small animals that scurry along the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I have given every green plant as food." It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.31">God looked at everything he had made, and he saw that it was very good. Evening came, then morning came—the sixth day.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Gen.2">
        <title type="chapter">Chapter 2</title>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.1">So the sky and earth were finished, along with everything in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.2">By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing, so on the seventh day he rested from all his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.3">God blessed the seventh day and set it apart as something special because on that day he rested from all the creative work he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.4">This is the account of the sky and earth when they were created, when Yahweh God made the earth and sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.5">No wild plants had yet appeared on the earth, and no crops had begun to grow, because Yahweh God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no one to work the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.6">Instead, water would come up from the earth and water the entire surface of the ground.<note type="translation">Hebrew 'ed can mean mist, stream, or spring</note></verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.7">Then Yahweh God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.8">Now Yahweh God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden, and there he put the man he had formed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.9">Yahweh God made all kinds of trees grow from the ground—trees that were beautiful to look at and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.10">A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was divided into four smaller rivers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.11">The name of the first is Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.12">The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin and precious stones are also there.<note type="translation">Hebrew 'bdolach and 'shoham refer to valuable materials, possibly pearls/resin and onyx</note></verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.13">The name of the second river is Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.14">The name of the third river is Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.15">Yahweh God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.16">And Yahweh God commanded the man, "You are free to eat from every tree in the garden;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.17">but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.18">Yahweh God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.19">Now Yahweh God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.20">So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals. But for Adam no suitable helper was found.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.21">So Yahweh God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs and then closed up the place with flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.22">Then Yahweh God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.23">The man said, "This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'woman,' because she was taken out of man."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.24">That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.25">Adam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.</verse>
