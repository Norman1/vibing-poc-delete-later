      <chapter osisID="Gen.1">
        <title type="chapter">Chapter 1</title>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.1">In the beginning, God created the sky and the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.2">The earth was formless and empty, with darkness covering the surface of the deep waters. God's spirit moved over the water's surface.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.3">God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.4">God saw that the light was good, so he separated the light from the darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.5">God called the light "day" and the darkness "night." Evening came, then morning came—the first day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.6">God said, "Let there be a dome in the middle of the water to separate water from water."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.7">So God made the dome and separated the water below the dome from the water above the dome. It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.8">God called the dome "sky." Evening came, then morning came—the second day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.9">God said, "Let the water under the sky gather into one place so the dry ground appears." It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.10">God called the dry ground "land" and the gathered water "seas." God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.11">God said, "Let the land produce vegetation: plants that make seeds and trees that bear fruit with seeds inside, each producing offspring like itself." It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.12">The land produced vegetation: plants that make seeds like themselves and trees that bear fruit with seeds inside like themselves. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.13">Evening came, then morning came—the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.14">God said, "Let there be lights in the sky to separate day from night. They will serve as signs to mark the seasons, days, and years.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.15">They will be lights in the sky to shine on the earth." It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.16">God made two great lights: the larger light to rule the day and the smaller light to rule the night. He also made the stars.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.17">God placed them in the sky to shine on the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.18">to rule over day and night, and to separate light from darkness. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.19">Evening came, then morning came—the fourth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.20">God said, "Let the water swarm with living creatures and let birds fly above the earth across the sky."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.21">God created the great sea creatures and every living thing that moves through the water in swarms, each producing offspring like itself. He also created every bird with wings, each producing offspring like itself. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.22">God blessed them, saying, "Have many offspring and fill the water in the seas. Let the birds multiply on the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.23">Evening came, then morning came—the fifth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.24">God said, "Let the land produce living creatures, each producing offspring like itself: livestock, small animals, and wild animals." It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.25">God made the wild animals, livestock, and all the small animals that move along the ground, each producing offspring like itself. God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.26">God said, "Let us make humans in our image, to be like us. They will rule over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the livestock, all the wild animals on earth, and the small animals that scurry along the ground."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.27">So God created humans in his own image. In the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.28">God blessed them and said to them, "Have many children and fill the earth. Take charge of it. Rule over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, and all the animals that move along the ground."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.29">God said, "Pay attention! I have given you every plant that produces seeds on the entire earth and every tree that has fruit with seeds. This will be your food.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.30">And to all the wild animals, all the birds in the sky, and all the small animals that scurry along the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I have given every green plant as food." It happened exactly as he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.1.31">God looked at everything he had made, and he saw that it was very good. Evening came, then morning came—the sixth day.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Gen.2">
        <title type="chapter">Chapter 2</title>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.1">So the sky and earth were finished, along with everything in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.2">By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing, so on the seventh day he rested from all his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.3">God blessed the seventh day and set it apart as something special because on that day he rested from all the creative work he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.4">This is the account of the sky and earth when they were created, when Yahweh God made the earth and sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.5">No wild plants had yet appeared on the earth, and no crops had begun to grow, because Yahweh God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no one to work the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.6">Instead, water would come up from the earth and water the entire surface of the ground.<note type="translation">Hebrew 'ed can mean mist, stream, or spring</note></verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.7">Then Yahweh God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.8">Now Yahweh God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden, and there he put the man he had formed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.9">Yahweh God made all kinds of trees grow from the ground—trees that were beautiful to look at and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.10">A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was divided into four smaller rivers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.11">The name of the first is Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.12">The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin and precious stones are also there.<note type="translation">Hebrew 'bdolach and 'shoham refer to valuable materials, possibly pearls/resin and onyx</note></verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.13">The name of the second river is Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.14">The name of the third river is Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.15">Yahweh God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.16">And Yahweh God commanded the man, "You are free to eat from every tree in the garden;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.17">but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.18">Yahweh God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.19">Now Yahweh God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.20">So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals. But for Adam no suitable helper was found.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.21">So Yahweh God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs and then closed up the place with flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.22">Then Yahweh God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.23">The man said, "This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'woman,' because she was taken out of man."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.24">That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.25">Adam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Gen.3">
        <title type="chapter">Chapter 3</title>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.1">Now the serpent was more cunning than any of the wild animals Yahweh God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God really say, 'You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.2">The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.3">but God did say, 'You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.4">"You will not certainly die," the serpent said to the woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.5">"For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.6">When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eyes, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.7">Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.8">Then the man and his wife heard the sound of Yahweh God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from Yahweh God among the trees of the garden.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.9">But Yahweh God called to the man, "Where are you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.10">He answered, "I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.11">And he said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.12">The man said, "The woman you put here with me—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.13">Then Yahweh God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?" The woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.14">So Yahweh God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and all wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.15">And I will put hostility between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.16">To the woman he said, "I will make your pains in childbearing very severe; with painful labor you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.17">To Adam he said, "Because you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I commanded you, 'You must not eat from it,' cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.18">It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.19">By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.20">Adam named his wife Eve, because she would become the mother of all the living.<note type="translation">Hebrew 'Havvah sounds like the Hebrew for 'living'</note></verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.21">Yahweh God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.22">And Yahweh God said, "The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.23">So Yahweh God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.24">After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Gen.4">
        <title type="chapter">Chapter 4</title>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.1">Adam made love to his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said, "With Yahweh's help, I have brought forth a man."<note type="translation">Hebrew 'qaniti sounds like the name Cain</note></verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.2">Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.3">In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.4">And Abel also brought an offering—fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. Yahweh looked with favor on Abel and his offering,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.5">but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.6">Then Yahweh said to Cain, "Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.7">If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.8">Now Cain said to his brother Abel, "Let's go out to the field." While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.9">Then Yahweh said to Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" "I don't know," he replied. "Am I my brother's keeper?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.10">Yahweh said, "What have you done? Listen! Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.11">Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.12">When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.13">Cain said to Yahweh, "My punishment is more than I can bear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.14">Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.15">But Yahweh said to him, "Not so; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over." Then Yahweh put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.16">So Cain went out from Yahweh's presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.17">Cain made love to his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.18">To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.19">Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.20">Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.21">His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play the harp and flute.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.22">Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain's sister was Naamah.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.23">Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.24">If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.25">Adam made love to his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, "God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.4.26">Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to call on the name of Yahweh.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Gen.6">
        <title type="chapter">Chapter 6</title>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.1">When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.2">the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.3">Then Yahweh said, "My Spirit will not contend with humans forever, for they are mortal; their days will be a hundred and twenty years."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.4">The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.5">Yahweh saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.6">Yahweh regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.7">So Yahweh said, "I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created—and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground—for I regret that I have made them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.8">But Noah found favor in the eyes of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.6.9">This is the account of Noah and his family. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.8.2">Now the springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens had been closed, and the rain had stopped falling from the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.8.3">The water receded steadily from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.8.8">Then he sent out a dove to see if the water had receded from the surface of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.8.9">But the dove could find nowhere to perch because there was water over all the surface of the earth; so it returned to Noah in the ark. He reached out his hand and took the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.8.10">He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.8.11">When the dove returned to him in the evening, there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.8.13">By the first day of the first month of Noah's six hundred and first year, the water had dried up from the earth. Noah then removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.8.14">By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.8.21">Yahweh smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart: "Never again will I curse the ground because of humans, even though every inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood. And never again will I destroy all living creatures, as I have done.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.12.8">From there he went on toward the hills east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to Yahweh and called on the name of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.12.9">Then Abram set out and continued toward the Negev.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.12.10">Now there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while because the famine was severe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.12.11">As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, "I know what a beautiful woman you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.12.12">When the Egyptians see you, they will say, 'This is his wife.' Then they will kill me but will let you live.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.12.13">Say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.12.14">When Abram came to Egypt, the Egyptians saw that Sarai was a very beautiful woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.12.15">And when Pharaoh's officials saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into his palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.12.16">He treated Abram well for her sake, and Abram acquired sheep and cattle, male and female donkeys, male and female servants, and camels.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.12.17">But Yahweh inflicted serious diseases on Pharaoh and his household because of Abram's wife Sarai.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.12.18">So Pharaoh summoned Abram. "What have you done to me?" he said. "Why didn't you tell me she was your wife?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.12.19">Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her to be my wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her and go!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.12.20">Then Pharaoh gave orders about Abram to his men, and they sent him on his way, with his wife and everything he had.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.13.1">So Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev, with his wife and everything he had, and Lot went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.2">Abram had become very wealthy in livestock and in silver and gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.3">From the Negev he went from place to place until he came to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had been earlier</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.4">and where he had first built an altar. There Abram called on the name of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.5">Now Lot, who was moving about with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.6">But the land could not support them while they stayed together, for their possessions were so great that they were not able to stay together.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.7">And quarreling arose between Abram's herders and Lot's. The Canaanites and Perizzites were also living in the land at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.8">So Abram said to Lot, "Let's not have any quarreling between you and me, or between your herders and mine, for we are close relatives.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.9">Is not the whole land before you? Let's part company. If you go to the left, I'll go to the right; if you go to the right, I'll go to the left."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.10">Lot looked around and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan toward Zoar was well watered, like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt. (This was before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.11">So Lot chose for himself the whole plain of the Jordan and set out toward the east. The two men parted company:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.12">Abram lived in the land of Canaan, while Lot lived among the cities of the plain and pitched his tents near Sodom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.13">Now the people of Sodom were wicked and were sinning greatly against Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.14">Yahweh said to Abram after Lot had parted from him, "Look around from where you are, to the north and south, to the east and west.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.15">All the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.16">I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust, then your offspring could be counted.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.13.17">Go, walk through the length and breadth of the land, for I am giving it to you."</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.14.1">At the time when Amraphel was king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of Goyim,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.14.2">these kings went to war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboyim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.14.3">All these latter kings joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Dead Sea Valley).</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.14.4">For twelve years they had been subject to Kedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.14.5">In the fourteenth year, Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him went out and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, the Emites in Shaveh Kiriathaim</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.14.6">and the Horites in the hill country of Seir, as far as El Paran near the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.14.7">Then they turned back and went to En Mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and they conquered the whole territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who were living in Hazezon Tamar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.14.8">Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboyim and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) marched out and drew up their battle lines in the Valley of Siddim</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.14.9">against Kedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goyim, Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar—four kings against five.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.14.10">Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits, and when the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some of the men fell into them and the rest fled to the hills.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.14.11">The four kings seized all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food; then they went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.14.12">They also carried off Abram's nephew Lot and his possessions, since he was living in Sodom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.14.13">A man who had escaped came and reported this to Abram the Hebrew. Now Abram was living near the great trees of Mamre the Amorite, a brother of Eshkol and Aner, all of whom were allied with Abram.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.14.14">When Abram heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.14.15">During the night Abram divided his men to attack them and he routed them, pursuing them as far as Hobah, north of Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.14.16">He recovered all the goods and brought back his relative Lot and his possessions, together with the women and the other people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.14.17">After Abram returned from defeating Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him, the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley).</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.14.18">Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High,</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.15.2">But Abram said, "Sovereign Yahweh, what can you give me since I remain childless and the one who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.15.3">And Abram said, "You have given me no children; so a servant in my household will be my heir."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.15.4">Then the word of Yahweh came to him: "This man will not be your heir, but a son who is your own flesh and blood will be your heir."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.15.5">He took him outside and said, "Look up at the sky and count the stars—if indeed you can count them." Then he said to him, "So shall your offspring be."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.15.6">Abram believed Yahweh, and he credited it to him as righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.15.7">He also said to him, "I am Yahweh, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it."</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.15.9">So Yahweh said to him, "Bring me a heifer, a goat and a ram, each three years old, along with a dove and a young pigeon."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.15.10">Abram brought all these to him, cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other; the birds, however, he did not cut in half.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.15.11">Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.15.12">As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.15.13">Then Yahweh said to him, "Know for certain that for four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own and that they will be enslaved and mistreated there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.15.14">But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will come out with great possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.15.15">You, however, will go to your ancestors in peace and be buried at a good old age.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.15.16">In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.15.17">When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, a smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.15.18">On that day Yahweh made a covenant with Abram and said, "To your descendants I give this land, from the Wadi of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates—</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.16.1">Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian slave named Hagar;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.16.2">so she said to Abram, "Yahweh has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my slave; perhaps I can build a family through her." Abram agreed to what Sarai said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.16.3">So after Abram had been living in Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took her Egyptian slave Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.16.4">He slept with Hagar, and she conceived. When she knew she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.16.5">Then Sarai said to Abram, "You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my slave in your arms, and now that she knows she is pregnant, she despises me. May Yahweh judge between you and me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.16.6">"Your slave is in your hands," Abram said. "Do with her whatever you think best." Then Sarai mistreated Hagar; so she fled from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.16.7">The angel of Yahweh found Hagar near a spring in the desert; it was the spring that is beside the road to Shur.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.16.8">And he said, "Hagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?" "I'm running away from my mistress Sarai," she answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.16.9">Then the angel of Yahweh told her, "Go back to your mistress and submit to her."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.16.10">The angel added, "I will increase your descendants so much that they will be too numerous to count."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.16.11">The angel of Yahweh also said to her: "You are now pregnant and you will give birth to a son. You shall name him Ishmael, for Yahweh has heard of your misery.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.16.12">He will be a wild donkey of a man; his hand will be against everyone and everyone's hand against him, and he will live in hostility toward all his brothers."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.16.13">She gave this name to Yahweh who spoke to her: "You are the God who sees me," for she said, "I have now seen the One who sees me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.16.14">That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi; it is still there, between Kadesh and Bered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.16.15">So Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Gen.17.15">God also said to Abraham, "As for Sarai your wife, you are no longer to call her Sarai; her name will be Sarah.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.17.16">I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.17.17">Abraham fell facedown; he laughed and said to himself, "Will a son be born to a man a hundred years old? Will Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.17.18">And Abraham said to God, "If only Ishmael might live under your blessing!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.17.19">Then God said, "Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Gen.17.20">And as for Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation.</verse>
