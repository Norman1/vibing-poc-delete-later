      <title>The Book of Esther</title>
      <div type="introduction">
        <p>Esther records how God providentially saved the Jewish people from complete destruction during their exile in Persia. Though God's name is never mentioned, his hand is clearly seen working through ordinary people like Esther and Mordecai to preserve his covenant people. The book establishes the festival of Purim and demonstrates that God is sovereignly at work even when he seems absent.</p>

          <note type="study" n="1">Xerxes I (Persian: Khšayārša) ruled the Persian Empire from 486-465 BC. The Hebrew אֲחַשְׁוֵרוֹשׁ (Achashverosh) is the Hebrew rendering of his Persian name.</note>
          This happened during the time of Xerxes, who ruled over 127 provinces stretching from India to Ethiopia.

        <verse osisID="Esth.1.2">
          <note type="study" n="2">Susa (Shushan) was one of the capital cities of the Persian Empire, located in present-day Iran.</note>
          At that time King Xerxes reigned from his royal throne in the citadel of Susa.

        <verse osisID="Esth.1.3">
          In the third year of his reign, he gave a banquet for all his nobles and officials. The military leaders of Persia and Media, the princes, and the nobles of the provinces were present.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Esth.1.4">
          For a full 180 days he displayed the vast wealth of his kingdom and the splendor and glory of his majesty.

        <verse osisID="Esth.1.5">
          When these days were over, the king gave a banquet lasting seven days in the enclosed garden of the king's palace, for all the people from the least to the greatest who were in the citadel of Susa.

          The garden had hangings of white and blue linen, fastened with cords of white linen and purple material to silver rings on marble pillars. There were couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl and other costly stones.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Esth.1.7">
          Wine was served in goblets of gold, each one different from the other, and the royal wine was abundant, in keeping with the king's liberality.

          By the king's command each guest was allowed to drink with no restrictions, for the king instructed all the wine stewards to serve each man what he wished.

          Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King Xerxes.

          Then Memukan replied in the presence of the king and the nobles, "Queen Vashti has done wrong, not only against the king but also against all the nobles and the peoples of all the provinces of King Xerxes.

          This very day the Persian and Median women of the nobility who have heard about the queen's conduct will respond to all the king's nobles in the same way. There will be no end of disrespect and discord.

          <note type="study" n="7">Persian and Median law was considered unchangeable once established.</note>
          Therefore, if it pleases the king, let him issue a royal decree and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media, which cannot be repealed, that Vashti is never again to enter the presence of King Xerxes. Also let the king give her royal position to someone else who is better than she.

        <verse osisID="Esth.2.2">
          Then the king's personal attendants proposed, "Let a search be made for beautiful young virgins for the king.

        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Esth.2.4">
          Then let the young woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti." This advice appealed to the king, and he followed it.

          Mordecai had a cousin named Hadassah, whom he had brought up because she had neither father nor mother. This young woman, who was also known as Esther, had a lovely figure and was beautiful. Mordecai had taken her as his own daughter when her father and mother died.

        <verse osisID="Esth.2.8">
          When the king's order and edict had been proclaimed, many young women were brought to the citadel of Susa and put under the care of Hegai. Esther also was taken to the king's palace and entrusted to Hegai, who had charge of the harem.

          All the royal officials at the king's gate knelt down and paid honor to Haman, for the king had commanded this concerning him. But Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor.

          Day after day they spoke to him but he refused to comply. Therefore they told Haman about it to see whether Mordecai's behavior would be tolerated, for he had told them he was a Jew.

          When Haman saw that Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor, he was enraged.
