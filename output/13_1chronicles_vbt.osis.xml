        <verse osisID="1Chr.28.2">Then King <name type="person">David</name> rose to his feet and said, "Hear me, my brethren and my people: I had it in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, and for the footstool of our God, and had made preparations to build it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.28.3">But God said to me, 'You shall not build a house for My name, because you have been a man of war and have shed blood.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.28.4">However <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> God of <name type="geographic">Israel</name> chose me above all the house of my father to be king over <name type="geographic">Israel</name> forever, for He has chosen <name type="person">Judah</name> to be the ruler. And of the house of <name type="person">Judah</name>, the house of my father, and among the sons of my father, He was pleased with me to make me king over all <name type="geographic">Israel</name>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.28.5">And of all my sons (for <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> has given me many sons) He has chosen my son <name type="person">Solomon</name> to sit on the throne of the kingdom of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> over <name type="geographic">Israel</name>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.28.6">Now He said to me, '<name type="person">Solomon</name> your son, he shall build My house and My courts; for I have chosen him to be My son, and I will be his Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.28.7">Moreover I will establish his kingdom forever, if he is steadfast to observe My commandments and My judgments, as it is this day.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.28.8">Now therefore, in the sight of all <name type="geographic">Israel</name>, the assembly of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, and in the hearing of our God, be careful to seek out all the commandments of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> your God, that you may possess this good land, and leave it as an inheritance for your children after you forever.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Chr.28.9">"As for you, my son <name type="person">Solomon</name>, know the God of your father, and serve Him with a loyal heart and with a willing mind; for <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> searches all hearts and understands all the intent of the thoughts. If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will cast you off forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.28.10">Consider now, for <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary; be strong, and do it."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Chr.28.11">Then <name type="person">David</name> gave his son <name type="person">Solomon</name> the plans for the vestibule, its houses, its treasuries, its upper chambers, its inner chambers, and the place of the mercy seat;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.28.12">and the plans for all that he had by the Spirit, of the courts of the house of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, of all the chambers all around, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries for the dedicated things;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.28.13">also for the division of the priests and the <name type="person">Levites</name>, for all the work of the service of the house of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, and for all the articles of service in the house of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.28.14">He gave gold by weight for things of gold, for all articles used in every kind of service; also silver for all articles of silver by weight, for all articles used in every kind of service;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.28.15">the weight for the lampstands of gold, and their lamps of gold, by weight for each lampstand and its lamps; for the lampstands of silver by weight, for the lampstand and its lamps, according to the use of each lampstand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.28.16">And by weight he gave gold for the tables of the showbread, for each table, and silver for the tables of silver;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.28.17">also pure gold for the forks, the basins, the pitchers of pure gold, and the golden bowls—he gave gold by weight for every bowl; and for the silver bowls, silver by weight for every bowl;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.28.18">and refined gold by weight for the altar of incense, and for the construction of the chariot, that is, the gold cherubim that spread their wings and overshadowed the ark of the covenant of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.28.19">"All this," said <name type="person">David</name>, "<divineName>Yahweh</divineName> made me understand in writing, by His hand upon me, all the works of these plans."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Chr.28.20">And <name type="person">David</name> said to his son <name type="person">Solomon</name>, "Be strong and of good courage, and do it; do not fear nor be dismayed, for <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> God—my God—will be with you. He will not leave you nor forsake you, until you have finished all the work for the service of the house of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.28.21">Here are the divisions of the priests and the <name type="person">Levites</name> for all the service of the house of God; and every willing craftsman will be with you for all manner of workmanship, for every kind of service; also the leaders and all the people will be completely at your command."</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.1">Furthermore King <name type="person">David</name> said to all the assembly: "My son <name type="person">Solomon</name>, whom alone God has chosen, is young and inexperienced; and the work is great, because the temple is not for man but for <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.2">Now for the house of my God I have prepared with all my might: gold for things to be made of gold, silver for things of silver, bronze for things of bronze, iron for things of iron, wood for things of wood, onyx stones, stones to be set, glistening stones of various colors, all kinds of precious stones, and marble slabs in abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.3">Moreover, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the house set apart for God, my own special treasure of gold and silver:</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.4">three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of <name type="geographic">Ophir</name>, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.5">the gold for things of gold and the silver for things of silver, and for all kinds of work to be done by the hands of craftsmen. Who then is willing to consecrate himself this day to <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>?"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.6">Then the leaders of the fathers' houses, leaders of the tribes of <name type="geographic">Israel</name>, the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the officers over the king's work, offered willingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.7">They gave for the work of the house of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand talents of bronze, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.8">And whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, into the hand of <name type="person">Jehiel</name> the <name type="person">Gershonite</name>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.9">Then the people rejoiced, for they had offered willingly, because with a loyal heart they had offered willingly to <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>; and King <name type="person">David</name> also rejoiced greatly.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">David's Prayer</title>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.10">Therefore <name type="person">David</name> blessed <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> before all the assembly; and <name type="person">David</name> said:
        "Blessed are You, <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> God of <name type="geographic">Israel</name>, our Father, forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.11">Yours, O <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, is the greatness,
        The power and the glory,
        The victory and the majesty;
        For all that is in heaven and in earth is Yours;
        Yours is the kingdom, O <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>,
        And You are exalted as head over all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.12">Both riches and honor come from You,
        And You reign over all.
        In Your hand is power and might;
        In Your hand it is to make great
        And to give strength to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.13">Now therefore, our God,
        We thank You
        And praise Your glorious name.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.14">But who am I, and who are my people,
        That we should be able to offer so willingly as this?
        For all things come from You,
        And of Your own we have given You.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.15">For we are aliens and pilgrims before You,
        As were all our fathers;
        Our days on earth are as a shadow,
        And without hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.16">O <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> our God, all this abundance that we have prepared to build You a house for Your name set apart for God is from Your hand, and is all Your own.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.17">I know also, my God, that You test the heart and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things; and now with joy I have seen Your people, who are present here to offer willingly to You.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.18">O <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> God of <name type="person">Abraham</name>, <name type="person">Isaac</name>, and <name type="geographic">Israel</name>, our fathers, keep this forever in the intent of the thoughts of the heart of Your people, and fix their heart toward You.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.19">And give my son <name type="person">Solomon</name> a loyal heart to keep Your commandments and Your testimonies and Your statutes, to do all these things, and to build the temple for which I have made provision."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.20">Then <name type="person">David</name> said to all the assembly, "Now bless <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> your God." So all the assembly blessed <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> God of their fathers, and bowed their heads and prostrated themselves before <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> and the king.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">Solomon Anointed King</title>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.21">And they made sacrifices to <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> and offered burnt offerings to <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> on the next day: a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all <name type="geographic">Israel</name>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.22">So they ate and drank before <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> with great gladness on that day. And they made <name type="person">Solomon</name> the son of <name type="person">David</name> king the second time, and poured oil on him before <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> to be the leader, and <name type="person">Zadok</name> to be priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.23">Then <name type="person">Solomon</name> sat on the throne of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> as king instead of <name type="person">David</name> his father, and prospered; and all <name type="geographic">Israel</name> obeyed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.24">All the leaders and the mighty men, and also all the sons of King <name type="person">David</name>, submitted themselves to King <name type="person">Solomon</name>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.25">So <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> exalted <name type="person">Solomon</name> exceedingly in the sight of all <name type="geographic">Israel</name>, and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in <name type="geographic">Israel</name>.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">The Close of David's Reign</title>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.26">Thus <name type="person">David</name> the son of <name type="person">Jesse</name> reigned over all <name type="geographic">Israel</name>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.27">And the period that he reigned over <name type="geographic">Israel</name> was forty years; seven years he reigned in <name type="geographic">Hebron</name>, and thirty-three years he reigned in <name type="geographic">Jerusalem</name>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.28">So he died in a good old age, full of days and riches and honor; and <name type="person">Solomon</name> his son reigned in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.29">Now the acts of King <name type="person">David</name>, first and last, indeed they are written in the book of <name type="person">Samuel</name> the seer, in the book of <name type="person">Nathan</name> the prophet, and in the book of <name type="person">Gad</name> the seer,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Chr.29.30">with all his reign and his might, and the events that happened to him, to <name type="geographic">Israel</name>, and to all the kingdoms of the lands.</verse>
