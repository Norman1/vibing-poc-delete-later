      <chapter osisID="Exod.1" sID="Exod.1"/>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.1">These are the names of the Israelites who came to Egypt with Jacob, each bringing his family:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.2">Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.3">Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.4">Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.5">Joseph was already in Egypt. The total number of Jacob's descendants was seventy people.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.6">Eventually Joseph died, along with all his brothers and that entire generation.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.7">But the Israelites had many children and their population grew rapidly. They became very numerous and powerful, filling the land.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.8">Then a new king came to power in Egypt who didn't know anything about Joseph.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.9">He told his people, "Look, the Israelite people have become more numerous and powerful than we are.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.10">We need to deal with them carefully, or they'll continue to multiply. If war breaks out, they might join our enemies, fight against us, and leave the country."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.11">So the Egyptians appointed harsh supervisors over them to oppress them with forced labor. They built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Rameses.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.12">But the more the Egyptians oppressed them, the more the Israelites multiplied and spread throughout the land. This made the Egyptians deeply concerned about the Israelites.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.13">So the Egyptians worked the Israelites ruthlessly,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.14">making their lives bitter with harsh labor. They forced them to work with clay and bricks and do all kinds of field work. All their labor was brutal.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.15">The king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.16">He said, "When you help Hebrew women give birth, look at the baby when it's born. If it's a boy, kill him. If it's a girl, let her live."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.17">But the midwives had respectful awe of God, so they didn't follow the king's orders. They let the boys live.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.18">The king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, "Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.19">The midwives answered Pharaoh, "Hebrew women aren't like Egyptian women. They're vigorous and give birth before we midwives arrive."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.20">So God was good to the midwives, and the people continued to multiply and become very numerous.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.21">Because the midwives had respectful awe of God, he gave them families of their own.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.22">Then Pharaoh commanded all his people: "Every Hebrew boy who is born must be thrown into the Nile River, but let all the girls live."</verse>
      <chapter eID="Exod.1"/>
      <chapter osisID="Exod.2" sID="Exod.2"/>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.1">Now a man from Levi's family married a Levite woman.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.2">The woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a beautiful child, she hid him for three months.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.3">When she couldn't hide him any longer, she got a papyrus basket and coated it with tar and pitch. She put the child in it and placed it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile River.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.4">His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.5">Pharaoh's daughter came down to wash at the Nile River while her attendants walked along the riverbank. When she saw the basket among the reeds, she sent her female servant to get it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.6">She opened it and saw the child. The boy was crying, and she felt sorry for him. "This is one of the Hebrew children," she said.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.7">Then his sister asked Pharaoh's daughter, "Should I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.8">"Yes, go," Pharaoh's daughter told her. So the girl went and got the child's mother.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.9">Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this child and nurse him for me, and I will pay you." So the woman took the child and nursed him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.10">When the child grew older, she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, saying, "I pulled him out of the water."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.11">One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.12">Looking around and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.13">The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one who was in the wrong, "Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.14">The man said, "Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?" Then Moses was afraid and thought, "What I did must be known."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.15">When Pharaoh heard about this, he tried to kill Moses, but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian, where he sat down by a well.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.16">Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father's flock.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.17">Some shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.18">When the girls returned to Reuel their father, he asked them, "Why have you returned so early today?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.19">They answered, "An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.20">"And where is he?" he asked his daughters. "Why did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.21">Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave him his daughter Zipporah in marriage.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.22">Zipporah gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, saying, "I have become a foreigner in a foreign land."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.23">During that long period, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.24">God heard their groaning and remembered his covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.25">So God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them.</verse>
      <chapter eID="Exod.2"/>
      <chapter osisID="Exod.3" sID="Exod.3"/>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.1">Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.2">There the angel of Yahweh appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.3">So Moses thought, "I will go over and see this strange sight—why the bush does not burn up."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.4">When Yahweh saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, "Moses! Moses!" And Moses said, "Here I am."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.5">"Do not come any closer," God said. "Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is set apart for God."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.6">Then he said, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob." At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.7">Yahweh said, "I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.8">So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey—the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.9">And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.10">So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.11">But Moses said to God, "Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.12">And God said, "I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will bow down to God on this mountain."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.13">Moses said to God, "Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' Then what shall I tell them?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.14">God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: 'I AM has sent me to you.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.15">God also said to Moses, "Say to the Israelites, 'Yahweh, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob—has sent me to you.' This is my name forever, the name you shall call me from generation to generation.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.16">Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, 'Yahweh, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob—appeared to me and said: I have watched over you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.17">And I have promised to bring you up out of your misery in Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites—a land flowing with milk and honey.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.18">The elders of Israel will listen to you. Then you and the elders are to go to the king of Egypt and say to him, 'Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to Yahweh our God.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.19">But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand compels him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.20">So I will stretch out my hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders that I will perform among them. After that, he will let you go.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.21">And I will make the Egyptians favorably disposed toward this people, so that when you leave you will not go empty-handed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.22">Every woman is to ask her neighbor and any woman living in her house for articles of silver and gold and for clothing, which you will put on your sons and daughters. And so you will plunder the Egyptians."</verse>
      <chapter eID="Exod.3"/>
      <chapter osisID="Exod.4" sID="Exod.4"/>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.1">Moses answered, "What if they do not trust me or listen to me and say, 'Yahweh did not appear to you'?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.2">Then Yahweh said to him, "What is that in your hand?" "A staff," he replied.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.3">Yahweh said, "Throw it on the ground." Moses threw it on the ground and it became a snake, and he ran from it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.4">Then Yahweh said to him, "Reach out your hand and take it by the tail." So Moses reached out and took hold of the snake and it turned back into a staff in his hand.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.5">"This," said Yahweh, "is so that they may trust that Yahweh, the God of their fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob—has appeared to you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.6">Then Yahweh said, "Put your hand inside your cloak." So Moses put his hand into his cloak, and when he took it out, the skin was leprous—it had become as white as snow.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.7">"Now put it back into your cloak," he said. So Moses put his hand back into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored, like the rest of his flesh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.8">Then Yahweh said, "If they do not trust you or pay attention to the first sign, they may trust the second.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.9">But if they do not trust these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the river will become blood on the ground."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.10">Moses said to Yahweh, "Pardon your servant, Lord. I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.11">Yahweh said to him, "Who gave human beings their mouths? Who makes them deaf or mute? Who gives them sight or makes them blind? Is it not I, Yahweh?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.12">Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.13">But Moses said, "Pardon your servant, Lord. Please send someone else."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.14">Then Yahweh's anger burned against Moses and he said, "What about your brother, Aaron the Levite? I know he can speak well. He is already on his way to meet you, and he will be glad to see you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.15">You shall speak to him and put words in his mouth; I will help both of you speak and will teach you what to do.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.16">He will speak to the people for you, and it will be as if he were your mouth and as if you were God to him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.17">But take this staff in your hand so you can perform the signs with it."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.18">Then Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, "Let me return to my own people in Egypt to see if any of them are still alive." Jethro said, "Go, and I wish you well."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.19">Now Yahweh had said to Moses in Midian, "Go back to Egypt, for all those who wanted to kill you are dead."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.20">So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey and started back to Egypt. And he took the staff of God in his hand.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.21">Yahweh said to Moses, "When you return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have given you the power to do. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.22">Then say to Pharaoh, 'This is what Yahweh says: Israel is my firstborn son,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.23">and I told you, "Let my son go, so he may serve me." But you refused to let him go; so I will kill your firstborn son.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.24">At a lodging place on the way, Yahweh met Moses and was about to kill him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.25">But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son's foreskin and touched Moses' feet with it. "Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me," she said.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.26">So Yahweh let him alone. (At that time she said "bridegroom of blood," referring to circumcision.)</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.27">Yahweh said to Aaron, "Go into the wilderness to meet Moses." So he met Moses at the mountain of God and kissed him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.28">Then Moses told Aaron everything Yahweh had sent him to say, and also about all the signs he had commanded him to perform.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.29">Moses and Aaron brought together all the elders of the Israelites,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.30">and Aaron told them everything Yahweh had said to Moses. He also performed the signs before the people,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.31">and they trusted. And when they heard that Yahweh was concerned about them and had seen their misery, they bowed down and honored him.</verse>
      <chapter eID="Exod.4"/>
      <chapter osisID="Exod.5" sID="Exod.5"/>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.1">Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, "This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: 'Let my people go, so that they may hold a festival to me in the wilderness.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.2">Pharaoh said, "Who is Yahweh, that I should obey him and let Israel go? I do not know Yahweh and I will not let Israel go."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.3">Then they said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to Yahweh our God, or he may strike us with plagues or with the sword."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.4">But the king of Egypt said, "Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their labor? Get back to your work!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.5">Then Pharaoh said, "Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you are stopping them from working."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.6">That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and overseers in charge of the people:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.7">"You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks; let them go and gather their own straw.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.8">But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don't reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why they are crying out, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.9">Make the work harder for the people so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.10">Then the slave drivers and the overseers went out and said to the people, "This is what Pharaoh says: 'I will not give you any more straw.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.11">Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced at all.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.12">So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.13">The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, "Complete the work required of you for each day, just as when you had straw."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.14">And Pharaoh's slave drivers beat the Israelite overseers they had appointed, demanding, "Why haven't you met your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.15">Then the Israelite overseers went and appealed to Pharaoh: "Why have you treated your servants this way?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.16">Your servants are given no straw, yet we are told, 'Make bricks!' Your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.17">Pharaoh said, "Lazy, that's what you are—lazy! That is why you keep saying, 'Let us go and sacrifice to Yahweh.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.18">Now get to work. You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.19">The Israelite overseers realized they were in trouble when they were told, "You are not to reduce the number of bricks required of you for each day."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.20">When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.21">and they said, "May Yahweh look on you and judge you! You have made us obnoxious to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword in their hand to kill us."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.22">Moses returned to Yahweh and said, "Why, Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Is this why you sent me?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.23">Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people, and you have not rescued your people at all."</verse>
      <chapter eID="Exod.5"/>
      <chapter osisID="Exod.6" sID="Exod.6"/>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.1">Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh: Because of my mighty hand he will let them go; because of my mighty hand he will drive them out of his country."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.2">God also said to Moses, "I am Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.3">I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob as God Almighty, but by my name Yahweh I did not make myself fully known to them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.4">I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, where they resided as foreigners.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.5">Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered my covenant.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.6">Therefore, say to the Israelites: 'I am Yahweh, and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. I will free you from being slaves to them, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.7">I will take you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.8">And I will bring you to the land I swore with uplifted hand to give to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I am Yahweh.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.9">Moses reported this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and harsh labor.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.10">Then Yahweh said to Moses,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.11">"Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his country."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.12">But Moses said to Yahweh, "If the Israelites will not listen to me, why would Pharaoh listen to me, since I speak with faltering lips?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.13">Now Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron about the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he commanded them to bring the Israelites out of Egypt.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.14">These were the heads of their families: The sons of Reuben the firstborn son of Israel were Hanok and Pallu, Hezron and Karmi. These were the clans of Reuben.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.15">The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. These were the clans of Simeon.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.16">These were the names of the sons of Levi according to their records: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. Levi lived 137 years.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.17">The sons of Gershon, by clans, were Libni and Shimei.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.18">The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.19">The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These were the clans of Levi according to their records.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.20">Amram married his father's sister Jochebed, who bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.21">The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg and Zikri.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Exod.12.12">On that same night I will pass through Egypt and strike down every firstborn of both people and animals, and I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.13">The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are, and when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No destructive plague will touch you when I strike Egypt.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.14">This is a day you are to commemorate; for the generations to come you shall celebrate it as a festival to Yahweh—a lasting ordinance.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.15">For seven days you are to eat bread made without yeast. On the first day remove the yeast from your houses, for whoever eats anything with yeast in it from the first day through the seventh must be cut off from Israel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.16">On the first day hold a sacred assembly, and another one on the seventh day. Do no work at all on these days, except to prepare food for everyone to eat; that is all you may do.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.17">Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread, because it was on this very day that I brought your divisions out of Egypt. Celebrate this day as a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.18">In the first month you are to eat bread made without yeast, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.19">For seven days no yeast is to be found in your houses. And anyone, whether foreigner or native-born, who eats anything with yeast in it must be cut off from the community of Israel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.20">Eat nothing made with yeast. Wherever you live, you must eat unleavened bread."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.21">Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, "Go at once and select the animals for your families and slaughter the Passover lamb.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.22">Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin and put some of the blood on the top and on both sides of the doorframe. None of you shall go out of the door of your house until morning.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.23">When Yahweh goes through the land to strike down the Egyptians, he will see the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe and will pass over that doorway, and he will not permit the destroyer to enter your houses and strike you down.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.24">Obey these instructions as a lasting ordinance for you and your descendants.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.25">When you enter the land that Yahweh will give you as he promised, observe this ceremony.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.26">And when your children ask you, 'What does this ceremony mean to you?'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.27">then tell them, 'It is the Passover sacrifice to Yahweh, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt and spared our homes when he struck down the Egyptians.'" Then the people bowed down and honored Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.28">The Israelites did just what Yahweh commanded Moses and Aaron.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.29">At midnight Yahweh struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on the throne, to the firstborn of the prisoner, who was in the dungeon, and the firstborn of all the livestock as well.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.30">Pharaoh and all his officials and all the Egyptians got up during the night, and there was loud wailing in Egypt, for there was not a house without someone dead.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.31">During the night Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "Up! Leave my people, you and the Israelites! Go, serve Yahweh as you have requested.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.32">Take your flocks and herds, as you have said, and go. And also bless me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.33">The Egyptians urged the people to hurry and leave the country. "For otherwise," they said, "we will all die!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.34">So the people took their dough before the yeast was added, and carried it on their shoulders in kneading troughs wrapped in clothing.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.35">The Israelites did as Moses instructed and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold and for clothing.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.36">Yahweh had made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and they gave them what they asked for; so they plundered the Egyptians.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.37">The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Sukkoth. There were about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.38">Many other people went up with them, and also large droves of livestock, both flocks and herds.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.39">With the dough the Israelites had brought from Egypt, they baked loaves of unleavened bread. The dough was without yeast because they had been driven out of Egypt and did not have time to prepare food for themselves.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.40">Now the length of time the Israelite people lived in Egypt was 430 years.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.41">At the end of the 430 years, to the very day, all Yahweh's divisions left Egypt.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.42">Because Yahweh kept vigil that night to bring them out of Egypt, on this night all the Israelites are to keep vigil to honor Yahweh for the generations to come.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.43">Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, "These are the regulations for the Passover meal: No foreigner may eat it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.44">Any slave you have bought may eat it after you have circumcised him,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.45">but a temporary resident or a hired worker may not eat it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.46">It must be eaten inside the house; take none of the meat outside the house. Do not break any of the bones.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.47">The whole community of Israel must celebrate it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.48">A foreigner residing among you who wants to celebrate Yahweh's Passover must have all the males in his household circumcised; then he may take part like one born in the land. No uncircumcised male may eat it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.49">The same law applies both to the native-born and to the foreigner residing among you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.50">All the Israelites did just what Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.12.51">And on that very day Yahweh brought the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Exod.13.3">Then Moses said to the people, "Commemorate this day, the day you came out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery, because Yahweh brought you out of it with a mighty hand. Eat nothing containing yeast.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.13.4">Today, in the month of Aviv, you are leaving.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.13.5">When Yahweh brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites and Jebusites—the land he swore to your ancestors to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey—you are to observe this ceremony in this month:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.13.6">For seven days eat bread made without yeast and on the seventh day hold a festival to Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.13.7">Eat unleavened bread during those seven days; nothing with yeast in it is to be seen among you, nor shall any yeast be seen anywhere within your borders.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.13.8">On that day tell your son, 'I do this because of what Yahweh did for me when I came out of Egypt.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.13.9">This observance will be for you like a sign on your hand and a reminder on your forehead that this law of Yahweh is to be on your lips. For Yahweh brought you out of Egypt with his mighty hand.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.13.10">You must keep this ordinance at the appointed time year after year.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.13.11">After Yahweh brings you into the land of the Canaanites and gives it to you, as he promised on oath to you and your ancestors,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.13.12">you are to give over to Yahweh the first offspring of every womb. All the firstborn males of your livestock belong to Yahweh.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Exod.13.14">In days to come, when your son asks you, 'What does this mean?' say to him, 'With a mighty hand Yahweh brought us out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.13.15">When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, Yahweh killed the firstborn of both people and animals in Egypt. This is why I sacrifice to Yahweh the first male offspring of every womb and redeem each of my firstborn sons.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.13.16">And it will be like a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead that Yahweh brought us out of Egypt with his mighty hand."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.13.17">When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them on the road through the Philistine country, though that was shorter. For God said, "If they face war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.13.18">So God led the people around by the desert road toward the Red Sea. The Israelites went up out of Egypt ready for battle.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.13.19">Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because Joseph had made the Israelites swear an oath. He had said, "God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up with you from this place."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.13.20">After leaving Sukkoth they camped at Etham on the edge of the desert.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.13.21">By day Yahweh went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel by day or night.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.13.22">Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Exod.14" sID="Exod.14"/>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.1">Then Yahweh said to Moses,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.2">"Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp near Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. They are to encamp by the sea, directly opposite Baal Zephon.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.3">Pharaoh will think, 'The Israelites are wandering around the land in confusion, hemmed in by the desert.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.4">And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will pursue them. But I will gain honor for myself through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh." So the Israelites did this.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.5">When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them and said, "What have we done? We have let the Israelites go and have lost their services!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.6">So he had his chariot made ready and took his army with him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.7">He took six hundred of the best chariots, along with all the other chariots of Egypt, with officers over all of them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.8">Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, so that he pursued the Israelites, who were marching out boldly.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.9">The Egyptians—all Pharaoh's horses and chariots, horsemen and troops—pursued the Israelites and overtook them as they camped by the sea near Pi Hahiroth, opposite Baal Zephon.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.10">As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up, and there were the Egyptians, marching after them. They were terrified and cried out to Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.11">They said to Moses, "Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.12">Didn't we say to you in Egypt, 'Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians'? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.13">Moses answered the people, "Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance Yahweh will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today you will never see again.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.14">Yahweh will fight for you; you need only to be still."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.15">Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to move on.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.16">Raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea to divide the water so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.17">I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them. And I will gain honor through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots and his horsemen.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.18">The Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh when I gain honor through Pharaoh, his chariots and his horsemen."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.19">Then the angel of God, who had been traveling in front of Israel's army, withdrew and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved from in front and stood behind them,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.20">coming between the armies of Egypt and Israel. Throughout the night the cloud brought darkness to the one side and light to the other side; so neither went near the other all night long.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.21">Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night Yahweh drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turned it into dry land. The waters were divided,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.22">and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.23">The Egyptians pursued them, and all Pharaoh's horses and chariots and horsemen followed them into the sea.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.24">During the last watch of the night Yahweh looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud at the Egyptian army and threw it into confusion.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.25">He jammed the wheels of their chariots so that they had difficulty driving. And the Egyptians said, "Let's get away from the Israelites! Yahweh is fighting for them against Egypt."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.26">Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may flow back over the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.27">Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the sea went back to its place. The Egyptians were fleeing toward it, and Yahweh swept them into the sea.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.28">The water flowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen—the entire army of Pharaoh that had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them survived.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.29">But the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.30">That day Yahweh rescued Israel from the hands of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians lying dead on the shore.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.14.31">And when the Israelites saw the mighty hand of Yahweh displayed against the Egyptians, the people had respectful awe of Yahweh and put their trust in him and in Moses his servant.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Exod.15.6">Your right hand, Yahweh, was majestic in power. Your right hand, Yahweh, shattered the enemy.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Exod.15.8">By the blast of your nostrils the waters piled up. The surging waters stood up like a wall; the deep waters congealed in the heart of the sea.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.15.9">The enemy boasted, 'I will pursue, I will overtake them. I will divide the spoils; I will gorge myself on them. I will draw my sword and my hand will destroy them.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.15.10">But you blew with your breath, and the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Exod.15.17">You will bring them in and plant them on the mountain of your inheritance—the place, Yahweh, you made for your dwelling, the sanctuary, Lord, your hands established.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.15.18">Yahweh reigns for ever and ever."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.15.19">When Pharaoh's horses, chariots and horsemen went into the sea, Yahweh brought the waters of the sea back over them, but the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.15.20">Then Miriam the prophet, Aaron's sister, took a timbrel in her hand, and all the women followed her, with timbrels and dancing.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Exod.16.2">In the desert the whole community grumbled against Moses and Aaron.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.16.3">The Israelites said to them, "If only we had died by Yahweh's hand in Egypt! There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted, but you have brought us out into this desert to starve this entire assembly to death."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.16.4">Then Yahweh said to Moses, "I will rain down bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test them and see whether they will follow my instructions.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.16.5">On the sixth day they are to prepare what they bring in, and that is to be twice as much as they gather on the other days."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.16.6">So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, "In the evening you will know that it was Yahweh who brought you out of Egypt,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.16.7">and in the morning you will see the honor of Yahweh, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we, that you should grumble against us?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.16.8">Moses also said, "You will know that it was Yahweh when he gives you meat to eat in the evening and all the bread you want in the morning, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we? You are not grumbling against us, but against Yahweh."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.16.9">Then Moses told Aaron, "Say to the entire Israelite community, 'Come before Yahweh, for he has heard your grumbling.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.16.10">While Aaron was speaking to the whole Israelite community, they looked toward the desert, and there was the honor of Yahweh appearing in the cloud.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.16.11">Yahweh said to Moses,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.16.12">"I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, 'At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am Yahweh your God.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.16.13">That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.16.14">When the dew was gone, thin flakes like frost on the ground appeared on the desert floor.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.16.15">When the Israelites saw it, they said to each other, "What is it?" For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, "It is the bread Yahweh has given you to eat.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.16.16">This is what Yahweh has commanded: 'Everyone is to gather as much as they need. Take an omer for each person you have in your tent.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.16.17">The Israelites did as they were told; some gathered much, some little.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.16.18">And when they measured it by the omer, the one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little. Everyone had gathered just as much as they needed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.16.19">Then Moses said to them, "No one is to keep any of it until morning."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.16.20">However, some of them paid no attention to Moses; they kept part of it until morning, but it was full of maggots and began to smell. So Moses was angry with them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.16.21">Each morning everyone gathered as much as they needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.16.22">On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much—two omers for each person—and the leaders of the community came and reported this to Moses.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.16.23">He said to them, "This is what Yahweh commanded: 'Tomorrow is to be a day of sabbath rest, a set apart sabbath to Yahweh. So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.16.24">So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.16.25">"Eat it today," Moses said, "because today is a sabbath to Yahweh. You will not find any of it on the ground today.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.16.26">Six days you are to gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any."</verse>
