      <chapter osisID="Exod.1" sID="Exod.1"/>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.1">These are the names of the Israelites who came to Egypt with Jacob, each bringing his family:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.2">Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.3">Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.4">Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.5">Joseph was already in Egypt. The total number of Jacob's descendants was seventy people.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.6">Eventually Joseph died, along with all his brothers and that entire generation.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.7">But the Israelites had many children and their population grew rapidly. They became very numerous and powerful, filling the land.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.8">Then a new king came to power in Egypt who didn't know anything about Joseph.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.9">He told his people, "Look, the Israelite people have become more numerous and powerful than we are.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.10">We need to deal with them carefully, or they'll continue to multiply. If war breaks out, they might join our enemies, fight against us, and leave the country."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.11">So the Egyptians appointed harsh supervisors over them to oppress them with forced labor. They built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Rameses.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.12">But the more the Egyptians oppressed them, the more the Israelites multiplied and spread throughout the land. This made the Egyptians deeply concerned about the Israelites.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.13">So the Egyptians worked the Israelites ruthlessly,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.14">making their lives bitter with harsh labor. They forced them to work with clay and bricks and do all kinds of field work. All their labor was brutal.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.15">The king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.16">He said, "When you help Hebrew women give birth, look at the baby when it's born. If it's a boy, kill him. If it's a girl, let her live."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.17">But the midwives had respectful awe of God, so they didn't follow the king's orders. They let the boys live.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.18">The king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, "Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.19">The midwives answered Pharaoh, "Hebrew women aren't like Egyptian women. They're vigorous and give birth before we midwives arrive."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.20">So God was good to the midwives, and the people continued to multiply and become very numerous.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.21">Because the midwives had respectful awe of God, he gave them families of their own.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.1.22">Then Pharaoh commanded all his people: "Every Hebrew boy who is born must be thrown into the Nile River, but let all the girls live."</verse>
      <chapter eID="Exod.1"/>
      <chapter osisID="Exod.2" sID="Exod.2"/>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.1">Now a man from Levi's family married a Levite woman.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.2">The woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a beautiful child, she hid him for three months.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.3">When she couldn't hide him any longer, she got a papyrus basket and coated it with tar and pitch. She put the child in it and placed it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile River.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.4">His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.5">Pharaoh's daughter came down to wash at the Nile River while her attendants walked along the riverbank. When she saw the basket among the reeds, she sent her female servant to get it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.6">She opened it and saw the child. The boy was crying, and she felt sorry for him. "This is one of the Hebrew children," she said.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.7">Then his sister asked Pharaoh's daughter, "Should I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.8">"Yes, go," Pharaoh's daughter told her. So the girl went and got the child's mother.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.9">Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this child and nurse him for me, and I will pay you." So the woman took the child and nursed him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.10">When the child grew older, she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, saying, "I pulled him out of the water."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.11">One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.12">Looking around and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.13">The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one who was in the wrong, "Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.14">The man said, "Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?" Then Moses was afraid and thought, "What I did must be known."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.15">When Pharaoh heard about this, he tried to kill Moses, but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian, where he sat down by a well.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.16">Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father's flock.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.17">Some shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.18">When the girls returned to Reuel their father, he asked them, "Why have you returned so early today?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.19">They answered, "An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.20">"And where is he?" he asked his daughters. "Why did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.21">Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave him his daughter Zipporah in marriage.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.22">Zipporah gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, saying, "I have become a foreigner in a foreign land."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.23">During that long period, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.24">God heard their groaning and remembered his covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.2.25">So God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them.</verse>
      <chapter eID="Exod.2"/>
      <chapter osisID="Exod.3" sID="Exod.3"/>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.1">Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.2">There the angel of Yahweh appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.3">So Moses thought, "I will go over and see this strange sight—why the bush does not burn up."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.4">When Yahweh saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, "Moses! Moses!" And Moses said, "Here I am."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.5">"Do not come any closer," God said. "Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is set apart for God."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.6">Then he said, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob." At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.7">Yahweh said, "I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.8">So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey—the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.9">And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.10">So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.11">But Moses said to God, "Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.12">And God said, "I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will bow down to God on this mountain."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.13">Moses said to God, "Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' Then what shall I tell them?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.14">God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: 'I AM has sent me to you.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.15">God also said to Moses, "Say to the Israelites, 'Yahweh, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob—has sent me to you.' This is my name forever, the name you shall call me from generation to generation.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.16">Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, 'Yahweh, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob—appeared to me and said: I have watched over you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.17">And I have promised to bring you up out of your misery in Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites—a land flowing with milk and honey.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.18">The elders of Israel will listen to you. Then you and the elders are to go to the king of Egypt and say to him, 'Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to Yahweh our God.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.19">But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand compels him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.20">So I will stretch out my hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders that I will perform among them. After that, he will let you go.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.21">And I will make the Egyptians favorably disposed toward this people, so that when you leave you will not go empty-handed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.3.22">Every woman is to ask her neighbor and any woman living in her house for articles of silver and gold and for clothing, which you will put on your sons and daughters. And so you will plunder the Egyptians."</verse>
      <chapter eID="Exod.3"/>
      <chapter osisID="Exod.4" sID="Exod.4"/>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.1">Moses answered, "What if they do not trust me or listen to me and say, 'Yahweh did not appear to you'?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.2">Then Yahweh said to him, "What is that in your hand?" "A staff," he replied.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.3">Yahweh said, "Throw it on the ground." Moses threw it on the ground and it became a snake, and he ran from it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.4">Then Yahweh said to him, "Reach out your hand and take it by the tail." So Moses reached out and took hold of the snake and it turned back into a staff in his hand.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.5">"This," said Yahweh, "is so that they may trust that Yahweh, the God of their fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob—has appeared to you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.6">Then Yahweh said, "Put your hand inside your cloak." So Moses put his hand into his cloak, and when he took it out, the skin was leprous—it had become as white as snow.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.7">"Now put it back into your cloak," he said. So Moses put his hand back into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored, like the rest of his flesh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.8">Then Yahweh said, "If they do not trust you or pay attention to the first sign, they may trust the second.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.9">But if they do not trust these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the river will become blood on the ground."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.10">Moses said to Yahweh, "Pardon your servant, Lord. I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.11">Yahweh said to him, "Who gave human beings their mouths? Who makes them deaf or mute? Who gives them sight or makes them blind? Is it not I, Yahweh?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.12">Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.13">But Moses said, "Pardon your servant, Lord. Please send someone else."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.14">Then Yahweh's anger burned against Moses and he said, "What about your brother, Aaron the Levite? I know he can speak well. He is already on his way to meet you, and he will be glad to see you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.15">You shall speak to him and put words in his mouth; I will help both of you speak and will teach you what to do.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.16">He will speak to the people for you, and it will be as if he were your mouth and as if you were God to him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.17">But take this staff in your hand so you can perform the signs with it."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.18">Then Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, "Let me return to my own people in Egypt to see if any of them are still alive." Jethro said, "Go, and I wish you well."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.19">Now Yahweh had said to Moses in Midian, "Go back to Egypt, for all those who wanted to kill you are dead."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.20">So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey and started back to Egypt. And he took the staff of God in his hand.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.21">Yahweh said to Moses, "When you return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have given you the power to do. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.22">Then say to Pharaoh, 'This is what Yahweh says: Israel is my firstborn son,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.23">and I told you, "Let my son go, so he may serve me." But you refused to let him go; so I will kill your firstborn son.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.24">At a lodging place on the way, Yahweh met Moses and was about to kill him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.25">But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son's foreskin and touched Moses' feet with it. "Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me," she said.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.26">So Yahweh let him alone. (At that time she said "bridegroom of blood," referring to circumcision.)</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.27">Yahweh said to Aaron, "Go into the wilderness to meet Moses." So he met Moses at the mountain of God and kissed him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.28">Then Moses told Aaron everything Yahweh had sent him to say, and also about all the signs he had commanded him to perform.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.29">Moses and Aaron brought together all the elders of the Israelites,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.30">and Aaron told them everything Yahweh had said to Moses. He also performed the signs before the people,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.4.31">and they trusted. And when they heard that Yahweh was concerned about them and had seen their misery, they bowed down and honored him.</verse>
      <chapter eID="Exod.4"/>
      <chapter osisID="Exod.5" sID="Exod.5"/>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.1">Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, "This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: 'Let my people go, so that they may hold a festival to me in the wilderness.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.2">Pharaoh said, "Who is Yahweh, that I should obey him and let Israel go? I do not know Yahweh and I will not let Israel go."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.3">Then they said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to Yahweh our God, or he may strike us with plagues or with the sword."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.4">But the king of Egypt said, "Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their labor? Get back to your work!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.5">Then Pharaoh said, "Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you are stopping them from working."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.6">That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and overseers in charge of the people:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.7">"You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks; let them go and gather their own straw.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.8">But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don't reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why they are crying out, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.9">Make the work harder for the people so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.10">Then the slave drivers and the overseers went out and said to the people, "This is what Pharaoh says: 'I will not give you any more straw.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.11">Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced at all.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.12">So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.13">The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, "Complete the work required of you for each day, just as when you had straw."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.14">And Pharaoh's slave drivers beat the Israelite overseers they had appointed, demanding, "Why haven't you met your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.15">Then the Israelite overseers went and appealed to Pharaoh: "Why have you treated your servants this way?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.16">Your servants are given no straw, yet we are told, 'Make bricks!' Your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.17">Pharaoh said, "Lazy, that's what you are—lazy! That is why you keep saying, 'Let us go and sacrifice to Yahweh.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.18">Now get to work. You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.19">The Israelite overseers realized they were in trouble when they were told, "You are not to reduce the number of bricks required of you for each day."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.20">When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.21">and they said, "May Yahweh look on you and judge you! You have made us obnoxious to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword in their hand to kill us."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.22">Moses returned to Yahweh and said, "Why, Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Is this why you sent me?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.5.23">Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people, and you have not rescued your people at all."</verse>
      <chapter eID="Exod.5"/>
      <chapter osisID="Exod.6" sID="Exod.6"/>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.1">Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh: Because of my mighty hand he will let them go; because of my mighty hand he will drive them out of his country."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.2">God also said to Moses, "I am Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.3">I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob as God Almighty, but by my name Yahweh I did not make myself fully known to them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.4">I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, where they resided as foreigners.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.5">Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered my covenant.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.6">Therefore, say to the Israelites: 'I am Yahweh, and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. I will free you from being slaves to them, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.7">I will take you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.8">And I will bring you to the land I swore with uplifted hand to give to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I am Yahweh.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.9">Moses reported this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and harsh labor.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.10">Then Yahweh said to Moses,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.11">"Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his country."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.12">But Moses said to Yahweh, "If the Israelites will not listen to me, why would Pharaoh listen to me, since I speak with faltering lips?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.13">Now Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron about the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he commanded them to bring the Israelites out of Egypt.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.14">These were the heads of their families: The sons of Reuben the firstborn son of Israel were Hanok and Pallu, Hezron and Karmi. These were the clans of Reuben.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.15">The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. These were the clans of Simeon.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.16">These were the names of the sons of Levi according to their records: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. Levi lived 137 years.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.17">The sons of Gershon, by clans, were Libni and Shimei.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.18">The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.19">The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These were the clans of Levi according to their records.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.20">Amram married his father's sister Jochebed, who bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.21">The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg and Zikri.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Exod.6.25">Eleazar son of Aaron married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas. These were the heads of the Levite families, clan by clan.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.26">It was this same Aaron and Moses to whom Yahweh said, "Bring the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.27">They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing the Israelites out of Egypt—this same Moses and Aaron.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.28">Now when Yahweh spoke to Moses in Egypt,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.29">he said to him, "I am Yahweh. Tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I tell you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.6.30">But Moses said to Yahweh, "Since I speak with faltering lips, why would Pharaoh listen to me?"</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Exod.7" sID="Exod.7"/>
      <verse osisID="Exod.7.1">Then Yahweh said to Moses, "See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.7.2">You are to say everything I command you, and your brother Aaron is to tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go out of his country.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.7.3">But I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and though I multiply my signs and wonders in Egypt,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.7.4">he will not listen to you. Then I will lay my hand on Egypt and with mighty acts of judgment I will bring out my divisions, my people the Israelites.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.7.5">And the Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out of it."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.7.6">Moses and Aaron did just as Yahweh commanded them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.7.7">Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three when they spoke to Pharaoh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.7.8">Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron,</verse>

      <verse osisID="Exod.7.10">So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as Yahweh commanded. Aaron threw his staff down in front of Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a snake.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.7.11">Pharaoh then summoned wise men and sorcerers, and the Egyptian magicians also did the same things by their secret arts:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.7.12">Each one threw down his staff and it became a snake. But Aaron's staff swallowed up their staffs.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.7.13">Yet Pharaoh's heart became hard and he would not listen to them, just as Yahweh had said.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.7.14">Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is unyielding; he refuses to let the people go.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.7.15">Go to Pharaoh in the morning when he goes out to the river. Confront him on the bank of the Nile, and take in your hand the staff that was changed into a snake.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.7.16">Then say to him, 'Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to say to you: Let my people go, so that they may serve me in the wilderness. But until now you have not listened.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.7.17">This is what Yahweh says: By this you will know that I am Yahweh: With the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water of the Nile, and it will be changed into blood.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.7.18">The fish in the Nile will die, and the river will stink; the Egyptians will not be able to drink its water.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.7.19">Yahweh said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt—over the streams and canals, over the ponds and all the reservoirs—and they will turn to blood.' Blood will be everywhere in Egypt, even in vessels of wood and stone."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.7.20">Moses and Aaron did just as Yahweh had commanded. He raised his staff in the presence of Pharaoh and his officials and struck the water of the Nile, and all the water was changed into blood.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.7.21">The fish in the Nile died, and the river smelled so bad that the Egyptians could not drink its water. Blood was everywhere in Egypt.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.7.22">But the Egyptian magicians did the same things by their secret arts, and Pharaoh's heart became hard; he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as Yahweh had said.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.7.23">Instead, he turned and went into his palace, and did not take even this to heart.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.7.24">And all the Egyptians dug along the Nile to get drinking water, because they could not drink the water of the river.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.7.25">Seven days passed after Yahweh struck the Nile.</verse>
      <chapter eID="Exod.7"/>

      <verse osisID="Exod.8.1">Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and say to him, 'This is what Yahweh says: Let my people go, so that they may serve me.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.2">If you refuse to let them go, I will send a plague of frogs on your whole country.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.3">The Nile will teem with frogs. They will come up into your palace and your bedroom and onto your bed, into the houses of your officials and on your people, and into your ovens and kneading troughs.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.4">The frogs will come up on you and your people and all your officials.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.5">Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch out your hand with your staff over the streams and canals and ponds, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.6">So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.7">But the magicians did the same things by their secret arts; they also made frogs come up on the land of Egypt.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.8">Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "Pray to Yahweh to take the frogs away from me and my people, and I will let your people go to offer sacrifices to Yahweh."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.9">Moses said to Pharaoh, "I leave to you the honor of setting the time for me to pray for you and your officials and your people that you and your houses may be rid of the frogs, except for those that remain in the Nile."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.10">"Tomorrow," Pharaoh said. Moses replied, "It will be as you say, so that you may know there is no one like Yahweh our God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.11">The frogs will leave you and your houses, your officials and your people; they will remain only in the Nile."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.12">After Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh, Moses cried out to Yahweh about the frogs he had brought on Pharaoh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.13">And Yahweh did what Moses asked. The frogs died in the houses, in the courtyards and in the fields.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.14">They were piled into heaps, and the land reeked of them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.15">But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as Yahweh had said.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.16">Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the ground,' and throughout the land of Egypt the dust will become gnats."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.17">They did this, and when Aaron stretched out his hand with the staff and struck the dust of the ground, gnats came on people and animals. All the dust throughout the land of Egypt became gnats.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.18">But when the magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret arts, they could not. Since the gnats were on people and animals everywhere,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.19">the magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God." But Pharaoh's heart was hard and he would not listen, just as Yahweh had said.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.20">Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Get up early in the morning and confront Pharaoh as he goes to the river and say to him, 'This is what Yahweh says: Let my people go, so that they may serve me.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.21">If you do not let my people go, I will send swarms of flies on you and your officials, on your people and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies; even the ground will be covered with them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.22">But on that day I will deal differently with the land of Goshen, where my people live; no swarms of flies will be there, so that you will know that I, Yahweh, am in this land.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.23">I will make a distinction between my people and your people. This sign will occur tomorrow.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.24">And Yahweh did this. Dense swarms of flies poured into Pharaoh's palace and into the houses of his officials; throughout Egypt the land was ruined by the flies.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.25">Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "Go, sacrifice to your God here in the land."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.26">But Moses said, "That would not be right. The sacrifices we offer to Yahweh our God would be detestable to the Egyptians. And if we offer sacrifices that are detestable in their eyes, will they not stone us?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.27">We must take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to Yahweh our God, as he commands us."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.28">Pharaoh said, "I will let you go to offer sacrifices to Yahweh your God in the wilderness, but you must not go very far. Now pray for me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.29">Moses answered, "As soon as I leave you, I will pray to Yahweh, and tomorrow the flies will leave Pharaoh and his officials and his people. Only do not be deceitful again by not letting the people go to offer sacrifices to Yahweh."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.30">Then Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to Yahweh,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.31">and Yahweh did what Moses asked. The flies left Pharaoh and his officials and his people; not a fly remained.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.8.32">But this time also Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the people go.</verse>
      <chapter eID="Exod.8"/>
      <chapter osisID="Exod.9" sID="Exod.9"/>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.1">Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and say to him, 'This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says: "Let my people go, so that they may serve me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.2">If you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them back,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.3">the hand of Yahweh will bring a terrible plague on your livestock in the field—on your horses, donkeys and camels and on your cattle, sheep and goats.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.4">But Yahweh will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and that of Egypt, so that no animal belonging to the Israelites will die.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.5">Yahweh set a time and said, "Tomorrow Yahweh will do this in the land."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.6">And the next day Yahweh did it: All the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one animal belonging to the Israelites died.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.7">Pharaoh investigated and found that not even one of the animals of the Israelites had died. Yet his heart was unyielding and he would not let the people go.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.8">Then Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, "Take handfuls of soot from a furnace and have Moses toss it into the air in the presence of Pharaoh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.9">It will become fine dust over the whole land of Egypt, and festering boils will break out on people and animals throughout the land."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.10">So they took soot from a furnace and stood before Pharaoh. Moses tossed it into the air, and festering boils broke out on people and animals.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.11">The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils that were on them and on all the Egyptians.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.12">But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart and he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as Yahweh had said to Moses.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.13">Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Get up early in the morning, confront Pharaoh and say to him, 'This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says: Let my people go, so that they may serve me,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.14">or this time I will send the full force of my plagues against you and against your officials and your people, so you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.15">For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with a plague that would have wiped you off the earth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.16">But I have raised you up for this very purpose, that I might show you my power and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.17">You still set yourself against my people and will not let them go.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.18">Therefore, at this time tomorrow I will send the worst hailstorm that has ever fallen on Egypt, from the day it was founded till now.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.19">Give an order now to bring your livestock and everything you have in the field to a place of shelter, because the hail will fall on every person and animal that has not been brought in and is still out in the field, and they will die.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.20">Those officials of Pharaoh who had respectful awe of Yahweh's word hurried to bring their slaves and their livestock inside.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.21">But those who ignored Yahweh's word left their slaves and livestock in the field.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.22">Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that hail will fall all over Egypt—on people and animals and on everything growing in the fields of Egypt."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.23">When Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, Yahweh sent thunder and hail, and lightning flashed down to the ground. So Yahweh rained hail on the land of Egypt;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.24">hail fell and lightning flashed back and forth. It was the worst storm in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.25">Throughout Egypt hail struck everything in the fields—both people and animals; it beat down everything growing in the fields and stripped every tree.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.26">The only place it did not hail was the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.27">Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron. "This time I have done wrong," he said to them. "Yahweh is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.28">Pray to Yahweh, for we have had enough thunder and hail. I will let you go; you don't have to stay any longer."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.29">Moses replied, "When I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands in prayer to Yahweh. The thunder will stop and there will be no more hail, so you may know that the earth is Yahweh's.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.30">But I know that you and your officials still do not have respectful awe of Yahweh God."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.31">(The flax and barley were destroyed, since the barley had headed and the flax was in bloom.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.32">The wheat and spelt, however, were not destroyed, because they ripen later.)</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.33">Then Moses left Pharaoh and went out of the city. He spread out his hands toward Yahweh; the thunder and hail stopped, and the rain no longer poured down on the land.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.34">When Pharaoh saw that the rain and hail and thunder had stopped, he did wrong again: He and his officials hardened their hearts.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.9.35">So Pharaoh's heart was hard and he would not let the Israelites go, just as Yahweh had said through Moses.</verse>
      <chapter eID="Exod.9"/>
      <chapter osisID="Exod.10" sID="Exod.10"/>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.1">Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his officials so that I may perform these signs of mine among them</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.2">that you may tell your children and grandchildren how I dealt harshly with the Egyptians and how I performed my signs among them, and that you may know that I am Yahweh."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.3">So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, "This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says: 'How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, so that they may serve me.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.4">If you refuse to let my people go, I will bring locusts into your country tomorrow.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.5">They will cover the face of the ground so that it cannot be seen. They will devour what little you have left after the hail, including every tree that is growing in your fields.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.6">They will fill your houses and those of all your officials and all the Egyptians—something neither your fathers nor your ancestors have ever seen from the day they settled in this land till now.'" Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.7">Pharaoh's officials said to him, "How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the people go, so that they may serve Yahweh their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is ruined?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.8">Then Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. "Go, serve Yahweh your God," he said. "But tell me who will be going."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.9">Moses answered, "We will go with our young and our old, with our sons and our daughters, and with our flocks and herds, because we are to celebrate a festival to Yahweh."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.10">Pharaoh said, "Yahweh be with you—if I let you go, along with your women and children! Clearly you are bent on evil.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.11">No! Have only the men go and serve Yahweh, since that's what you have been asking for." Then Moses and Aaron were driven out of Pharaoh's presence.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.12">And Yahweh said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over Egypt so that locusts swarm over the land and devour everything growing in the fields, everything left by the hail."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.13">So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt, and Yahweh made an east wind blow across the land all that day and all that night. By morning the wind had brought the locusts;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.14">they invaded all Egypt and settled down in every area of the country in great numbers. Never before had there been such a plague of locusts, nor will there ever be again.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.15">They covered all the ground until it was black. They devoured all that was left after the hail—every plant in the fields and the fruit of every tree. Nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land of Egypt.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.16">Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "I have done wrong against Yahweh your God and against you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.17">Now forgive my wrongdoing once more and pray to Yahweh your God to take this deadly plague away from me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.18">Moses then left Pharaoh and prayed to Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.19">And Yahweh changed the wind to a very strong west wind, which caught up the locusts and carried them into the Red Sea. Not a locust was left anywhere in Egypt.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.20">But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let the Israelites go.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.21">Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that darkness spreads over Egypt—darkness that can be felt."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.22">So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness covered all Egypt for three days.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.23">No one could see anyone else or move about for three days. Yet all the Israelites had light in the places where they lived.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.24">Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, "Go, serve Yahweh. Even your women and children may go with you; only leave your flocks and herds behind."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.25">But Moses said, "You must also give us sacrifices and burnt offerings to present to Yahweh our God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.26">Our livestock too must go with us; not a hoof is to be left behind. We have to use some of them in serving Yahweh our God, and until we get there we will not know what we are to use to serve Yahweh."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.27">But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he was not willing to let them go.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.28">Pharaoh said to Moses, "Get out of my sight! Make sure you do not appear before me again! The day you see my face you will die."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Exod.10.29">"Just as you say," Moses replied. "I will never appear before you again."</verse>
