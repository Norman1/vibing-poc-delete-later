      <title type="sub">Opening Greeting and Thanksgiving</title>
      
      <verse osisID="1Thess.1.1" sID="1Thess.1.1"/>Paul, Silas, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians united with God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. May God give you kindness and peace.<verse eID="1Thess.1.1"/>
      
      <verse osisID="1Thess.1.2" sID="1Thess.1.2"/>We thank God continually for all of you, mentioning you constantly in our prayers<verse eID="1Thess.1.2"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.1.3" sID="1Thess.1.3"/>as we remember your faithful work, your loving service, and your patient hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our God and Father.<verse eID="1Thess.1.3"/>
      
      <verse osisID="1Thess.1.4" sID="1Thess.1.4"/>We know, brothers and sisters beloved by God, that he has chosen you,<verse eID="1Thess.1.4"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.1.5" sID="1Thess.1.5"/>because our good news didn't come to you just in words, but also with power, with the Spirit that sets people apart for God, and with complete conviction. You know what kind of people we proved to be among you for your sake.<verse eID="1Thess.1.5"/>
      
      <title type="sub">The Thessalonians' Faith Becomes an Example</title>
      
      <verse osisID="1Thess.1.6" sID="1Thess.1.6"/>You became imitators of us and of the Lord when you received the message during great suffering, yet with joy given by the Spirit that sets people apart for God.<verse eID="1Thess.1.6"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.1.7" sID="1Thess.1.7"/>As a result, you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.<verse eID="1Thess.1.7"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.1.8" sID="1Thess.1.8"/>For the Lord's message has sounded out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but your faith in God has spread everywhere, so we don't need to say anything about it.<verse eID="1Thess.1.8"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.1.9" sID="1Thess.1.9"/>People everywhere report about our visit to you and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God,<verse eID="1Thess.1.9"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.1.10" sID="1Thess.1.10"/>and to wait for his Son from heaven—Jesus, whom he raised from the dead, who rescues us from the coming anger of God.<verse eID="1Thess.1.10"/>
      
      <chapter eID="1Thess.1"/>
      
      <chapter osisID="1Thess.2" sID="1Thess.2"/>
      <title type="sub">Paul's Ministry in Thessalonica</title>
      
      <verse osisID="1Thess.2.1" sID="1Thess.2.1"/>You yourselves know, brothers and sisters, that our visit to you was not without results.<verse eID="1Thess.2.1"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.2.2" sID="1Thess.2.2"/>We had already suffered and been insulted in Philippi, as you know, but our God gave us courage to speak his good news to you despite strong opposition.<verse eID="1Thess.2.2"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.2.3" sID="1Thess.2.3"/>Our appeal doesn't come from error, impure motives, or deception.<verse eID="1Thess.2.3"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.2.4" sID="1Thess.2.4"/>Instead, just as God has examined us and entrusted us with the good news, we speak not to please people but to please God, who examines our hearts.<verse eID="1Thess.2.4"/>
      
      <verse osisID="1Thess.2.5" sID="1Thess.2.5"/>We never used flattering speech, as you know, nor did we have greedy motives—God is our witness.<verse eID="1Thess.2.5"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.2.6" sID="1Thess.2.6"/>We weren't looking for praise from people, either from you or from others, even though as Christ's apostles we could have asserted our authority.<verse eID="1Thess.2.6"/>
      
      <title type="sub">Paul's Gentle Care</title>
      
      <verse osisID="1Thess.2.7" sID="1Thess.2.7"/>Instead, we were gentle among you, like a nursing mother tenderly caring for her own children.<verse eID="1Thess.2.7"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.2.8" sID="1Thess.2.8"/>In our deep affection for you, we were delighted to share with you not only God's good news but also our own lives, because you had become so dear to us.<verse eID="1Thess.2.8"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.2.9" sID="1Thess.2.9"/>Surely you remember, brothers and sisters, our hard work and hardship. We worked night and day so we wouldn't burden any of you while we preached God's good news to you.<verse eID="1Thess.2.9"/>
      
      <verse osisID="1Thess.2.10" sID="1Thess.2.10"/>You are witnesses, and so is God, of how purely, doing what's right, and blamelessly we conducted ourselves among you who believe.<verse eID="1Thess.2.10"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.2.11" sID="1Thess.2.11"/>For you know that we treated each of you as a father treats his own children,<verse eID="1Thess.2.11"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.2.12" sID="1Thess.2.12"/>encouraging, comforting, and urging you to live lives worthy of God, who calls you into his kingdom and glory.<verse eID="1Thess.2.12"/>
      
      <title type="sub">The Thessalonians Received God's Message</title>
      
      <verse osisID="1Thess.2.13" sID="1Thess.2.13"/>And we also thank God continually because when you received the word of God that you heard from us, you accepted it not as a human message, but as it actually is, the word of God, which is indeed at work in you who believe.<verse eID="1Thess.2.13"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.2.14" sID="1Thess.2.14"/>For you, brothers and sisters, became imitators of God's churches in Judea, which are united with Christ Jesus. You suffered the same things from your own countrymen as they did from the Judeans<verse eID="1Thess.2.14"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.2.15" sID="1Thess.2.15"/>who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and also drove us out. They displease God and oppose all humanity<verse eID="1Thess.2.15"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.2.16" sID="1Thess.2.16"/>by hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. In this way they always heap up their sins to the limit. The anger of God has come upon them completely.<note>The Greek word <foreign>ὀργή</foreign> refers to God's anger against sin.</note><verse eID="1Thess.2.16"/>
      
      <title type="sub">Paul's Longing to See the Thessalonians</title>
      
      <verse osisID="1Thess.2.17" sID="1Thess.2.17"/>But brothers and sisters, when we were orphaned by being separated from you for a short time—in person, not in heart—we made every effort with great longing to see you face to face.<verse eID="1Thess.2.17"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.2.18" sID="1Thess.2.18"/>For we wanted to come to you—certainly I, Paul, did, again and again—but Satan blocked our way.<verse eID="1Thess.2.18"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.2.19" sID="1Thess.2.19"/>For what is our hope, our joy, or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes? Is it not you?<verse eID="1Thess.2.19"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.2.20" sID="1Thess.2.20"/>Indeed, you are our glory and joy.<verse eID="1Thess.2.20"/>
      
      <chapter eID="1Thess.2"/>
      
      <chapter osisID="1Thess.3" sID="1Thess.3"/>
      <title type="sub">Timothy's Encouraging Report</title>
      
      <verse osisID="1Thess.3.1" sID="1Thess.3.1"/>So when we could stand it no longer, we thought it best to be left by ourselves in Athens.<verse eID="1Thess.3.1"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.3.2" sID="1Thess.3.2"/>We sent Timothy, our brother and co-worker in God's service in spreading the good news about Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in your faith,<verse eID="1Thess.3.2"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.3.3" sID="1Thess.3.3"/>so that no one would be unsettled by these trials. For you know quite well that we are destined for them.<verse eID="1Thess.3.3"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.3.4" sID="1Thess.3.4"/>In fact, when we were with you, we kept telling you that we would be persecuted. And it turned out that way, as you well know.<verse eID="1Thess.3.4"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.3.5" sID="1Thess.3.5"/>For this reason, when I could stand it no longer, I sent to find out about your faith. I was afraid that somehow the tempter might have tempted you and that our labors might have been in vain.<verse eID="1Thess.3.5"/>
      
      <verse osisID="1Thess.3.6" sID="1Thess.3.6"/>But Timothy has just now come to us from you and has brought good news about your faith and love. He has told us that you always have pleasant memories of us and that you long to see us, just as we also long to see you.<verse eID="1Thess.3.6"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.3.7" sID="1Thess.3.7"/>Therefore, brothers and sisters, in all our distress and persecution we were encouraged about you because of your faith.<verse eID="1Thess.3.7"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.3.8" sID="1Thess.3.8"/>For now we really live, since you are standing firm in the Lord.<verse eID="1Thess.3.8"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.3.9" sID="1Thess.3.9"/>How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy we have in the presence of our God because of you?<verse eID="1Thess.3.9"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.3.10" sID="1Thess.3.10"/>Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you again and supply what is lacking in your faith.<verse eID="1Thess.3.10"/>
      
      <title type="sub">Paul's Prayer for the Church</title>
      
      <verse osisID="1Thess.3.11" sID="1Thess.3.11"/>Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus clear the way for us to come to you.<verse eID="1Thess.3.11"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.3.12" sID="1Thess.3.12"/>May the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else, just as ours does for you.<verse eID="1Thess.3.12"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.3.13" sID="1Thess.3.13"/>May he strengthen your hearts so that you will be blameless and set apart for God in the presence of our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all his people set apart for God.<verse eID="1Thess.3.13"/>
      
      <chapter eID="1Thess.3"/>
      
      <chapter osisID="1Thess.4" sID="1Thess.4"/>
      <title type="sub">Living to Please God</title>
      
      <verse osisID="1Thess.4.1" sID="1Thess.4.1"/>As for other matters, brothers and sisters, we instructed you how to live in order to please God, as in fact you are living. Now we ask you and urge you in the Lord Jesus to do this more and more.<verse eID="1Thess.4.1"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.4.2" sID="1Thess.4.2"/>For you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.<verse eID="1Thess.4.2"/>
      
      <verse osisID="1Thess.4.3" sID="1Thess.4.3"/>It is God's will that you should be set apart for him: that you should avoid sexual sin.<verse eID="1Thess.4.3"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.4.4" sID="1Thess.4.4"/>Each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is set apart for God and honorable,<verse eID="1Thess.4.4"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.4.5" sID="1Thess.4.5"/>not in passionate lust like the pagans, who do not know God.<verse eID="1Thess.4.5"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.4.6" sID="1Thess.4.6"/>And in this matter no one should wrong or take advantage of a brother or sister. The Lord will punish all those who commit such sins, as we told you and warned you before.<verse eID="1Thess.4.6"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.4.7" sID="1Thess.4.7"/>For God did not call us to be impure, but to live lives set apart for him.<verse eID="1Thess.4.7"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.4.8" sID="1Thess.4.8"/>Therefore, anyone who rejects this instruction does not reject a human being but God, the very God who gives you his Spirit that sets people apart for God.<verse eID="1Thess.4.8"/>
      
      <title type="sub">Brotherly Love and Working Hard</title>
      
      <verse osisID="1Thess.4.9" sID="1Thess.4.9"/>Now about your love for one another we do not need to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love each other.<verse eID="1Thess.4.9"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.4.10" sID="1Thess.4.10"/>And in fact, you do love all of God's family throughout Macedonia. Yet we urge you, brothers and sisters, to do so more and more,<verse eID="1Thess.4.10"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.4.11" sID="1Thess.4.11"/>and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life: You should mind your own business and work with your hands, just as we told you,<verse eID="1Thess.4.11"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.4.12" sID="1Thess.4.12"/>so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody.<verse eID="1Thess.4.12"/>
      
      <title type="sub">The Coming of the Lord</title>
      
      <verse osisID="1Thess.4.13" sID="1Thess.4.13"/>Brothers and sisters, we do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death, so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind, who have no hope.<verse eID="1Thess.4.13"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.4.14" sID="1Thess.4.14"/>For we believe that Jesus died and rose again, and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him.<verse eID="1Thess.4.14"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.4.15" sID="1Thess.4.15"/>According to the Lord's word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep.<verse eID="1Thess.4.15"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.4.16" sID="1Thess.4.16"/>For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.<verse eID="1Thess.4.16"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.4.17" sID="1Thess.4.17"/>After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.<verse eID="1Thess.4.17"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.4.18" sID="1Thess.4.18"/>Therefore encourage one another with these words.<verse eID="1Thess.4.18"/>

      <title type="sub">The Day of the Lord</title>
      
      <verse osisID="1Thess.5.1" sID="1Thess.5.1"/>Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you,<verse eID="1Thess.5.1"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.5.2" sID="1Thess.5.2"/>for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.<verse eID="1Thess.5.2"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.5.3" sID="1Thess.5.3"/>While people are saying, "Peace and safety," destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.<verse eID="1Thess.5.3"/>
      
      <verse osisID="1Thess.5.4" sID="1Thess.5.4"/>But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief.<verse eID="1Thess.5.4"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.5.5" sID="1Thess.5.5"/>You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness.<verse eID="1Thess.5.5"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.5.6" sID="1Thess.5.6"/>So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober.<verse eID="1Thess.5.6"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.5.7" sID="1Thess.5.7"/>For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.<verse eID="1Thess.5.7"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.5.8" sID="1Thess.5.8"/>But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.<verse eID="1Thess.5.8"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.5.9" sID="1Thess.5.9"/>For God did not appoint us to suffer anger but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.<verse eID="1Thess.5.9"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.5.10" sID="1Thess.5.10"/>He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.<verse eID="1Thess.5.10"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.5.11" sID="1Thess.5.11"/>Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing.<verse eID="1Thess.5.11"/>
      
      <title type="sub">Final Instructions and Greetings</title>
      
      <verse osisID="1Thess.5.12" sID="1Thess.5.12"/>Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, to acknowledge those who work hard among you, who care for you in the Lord and who admonish you.<verse eID="1Thess.5.12"/> <verse osisID="1Thess.5.13" sID="1Thess.5.13"/>Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work.
