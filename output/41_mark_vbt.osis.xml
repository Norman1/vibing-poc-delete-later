      <div type="introduction">
        <p>Mark presents a fast-paced, action-packed account of Jesus' ministry, emphasizing his deeds more than his teachings. Written by John Mark, a companion of the apostle Peter, this Gospel portrays Jesus as the suffering servant who came to serve others and give his life as payment for many. Mark focuses on Jesus' power over demons, disease, and death, showing how the Son of God willingly went to the cross to accomplish salvation.</p>

      <chapter osisID="Mark.1" sID="Mark.1" />
      <title type="main">John the Baptist Prepares the Way</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.1">The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah<note type="translation">The Greek word "Christ" means "Anointed One" or "Messiah"</note>, the Son of God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.2">It is written in Isaiah the prophet: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way"—</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.3">"a voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.4">And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of changed minds<note type="translation">The Greek word "metanoia" means changing one's mind or way of thinking</note> for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.5">The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.6">John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.7">And this was his message: "After me comes the one more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.8">I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit<note type="translation">The Greek phrase means "Spirit that is set apart for God"</note>."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Baptism and Testing of Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.9">At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.10">Just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.11">And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.12">At once the Spirit sent him out into the wilderness,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.13">and he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Announces the Good News</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.14">After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.15">"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God has come near. Change your minds and believe the good news!"</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Calls the First Disciples</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.16">As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.17">"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will send you out to fish for people."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.18">At once they left their nets and followed him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.19">When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.20">Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Drives Out an Impure Spirit</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.21">They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.22">The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.23">Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an impure spirit cried out,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.24">"What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the One Set Apart by God<note type="translation">The Greek phrase "ho hagios tou theou" means the one set apart by God</note>!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.25">"Be quiet!" said Jesus sternly. "Come out of him!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.26">The impure spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.27">The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching—and with authority! He even gives orders to impure spirits and they obey him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.28">News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Heals Many</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.29">As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.30">Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they immediately told Jesus about her.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.31">So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.32">That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.33">The whole town gathered at the door,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.34">and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Prays in a Solitary Place</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.35">Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.36">Simon and his companions went to look for him,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.37">and when they found him, they exclaimed: "Everyone is looking for you!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.38">Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages—so I can preach there also. That is why I have come."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.39">So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Heals a Man With Leprosy</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.40">A man with leprosy<note type="translation">The Greek word can refer to various skin diseases</note> came to him and begged him on his knees, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.41">Jesus was indignant. He reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.42">Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.43">Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.44">"See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.45">Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.</verse>
      <chapter eID="Mark.1" />
      <chapter osisID="Mark.2" sID="Mark.2" />
      <title type="main">Jesus Heals a Paralyzed Man</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.1">A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.2">They gathered in such large numbers that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.3">Some men came, bringing to him a paralyzed man, carried by four of them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.4">Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging through it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on.<note type="background">Palestinian roofs were flat, made of branches and mud, easily opened.</note></verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.5">When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.6">Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.7">"Why does this fellow talk like that? He's insulting God<note type="translation">The Greek word "blasphemeo" means to insult or speak against the sacred</note>! Who can forgive sins but God alone?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.8">Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.9">Which is easier: to say to this paralyzed man, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take your mat and walk'?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.10">But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." So he said to the man,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.11">"I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.12">He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!"</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Calls Levi and Eats With Tax Collectors</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.13">Once again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.14">As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.15">While Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.16">When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.17">On hearing this, Jesus said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the upright, but sinners."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Questioned About Fasting</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.18">Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and asked Jesus, "How is it that John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.19">Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.20">But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.21">"No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.22">And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.23">One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.24">The Pharisees said to him, "Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.25">He answered, "Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.26">In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread<note type="translation">The Greek phrase "bread of the presence" refers to twelve loaves placed before God</note>, which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.27">Then he said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.28">So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."</verse>
      <chapter eID="Mark.2" />
      <chapter osisID="Mark.3" sID="Mark.3" />
      <title type="main">Jesus Heals on the Sabbath</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.1">Another time Jesus went into the synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.2">Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.3">Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand, "Stand up in front of everyone."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.4">Then Jesus asked them, "Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?" But they remained silent.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.5">He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.6">Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Crowds Follow Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.7">Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake, and a large crowd from Galilee followed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.8">When they heard about all he was doing, many people came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and the regions across the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.9">Because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, to keep the people from crowding him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.10">For he had healed many, so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.11">Whenever the impure spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, "You are the Son of God!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.12">But he gave them strict orders not to tell others about him.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Appoints the Twelve Apostles</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.13">Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.14">He appointed twelve that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.15">and to have authority to drive out demons.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.16">These are the twelve he appointed: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter),</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.17">James son of Zebedee and his brother John (to them he gave the name Boanerges, which means "sons of thunder"),</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.18">Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.19">and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Accused by His Family and by Teachers of the Law</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.20">Then Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.21">When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, "He is out of his mind."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.22">And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul<note type="translation">A name for Satan meaning "lord of flies"</note>! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.23">So Jesus called them over to him and began to speak to them in parables: "How can Satan drive out Satan?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.24">If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.25">If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.26">And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.27">In fact, no one can enter a strong man's house without first tying him up. Then he can plunder the strong man's house.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.28">Truly I tell you, people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.29">but whoever insults the Holy Spirit will never have forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.30">He said this because they were saying, "He has an impure spirit."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus' Mother and Brothers</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.31">Then Jesus' mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.32">A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, "Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.33">"Who are my mother and my brothers?" he asked.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.34">Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said, "Here are my mother and my brothers!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.35">Whoever does God's will is my brother and sister and mother."</verse>
      <chapter eID="Mark.3" />
      <chapter osisID="Mark.4" sID="Mark.4" />
      <title type="main">The Parable of the Sower</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.1">Again Jesus began to teach by the lake. The crowd that gathered around him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake, while all the people were along the shore at the water's edge.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.2">He taught them many things by parables, and in his teaching said:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.3">"Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.4">As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.5">Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.6">But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.7">Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.8">Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced a crop, some multiplying thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.9">Then Jesus said, "Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.10">When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.11">He told them, "The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.12">so that, 'they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.13">Then Jesus said to them, "Don't you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.14">The farmer sows the word.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.15">Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.16">Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.17">But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.18">Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.19">but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.20">Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop—some thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times what was sown."</verse>
      <title type="sub">A Lamp on a Stand</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.21">He said to them, "Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed? Instead, don't you put it on its stand?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.22">For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.23">If anyone has ears to hear, let them hear."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.24">"Consider carefully what you hear," he continued. "With the measure you use, it will be measured to you—and even more.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.25">Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Parable of the Growing Seed</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.26">He also said, "This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.27">Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.28">All by itself the soil produces grain—first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.29">As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Parable of the Mustard Seed</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.30">Again he said, "What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what parable shall we use to describe it?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.31">It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds on earth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.32">Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds can perch in its shade."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.33">With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.34">He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Calms the Storm</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.35">That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, "Let us go over to the other side."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.36">Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.37">A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.38">Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, "Teacher, don't you care if we drown?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.39">He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, "Quiet! Be still!" Then the wind died down and it was completely calm.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.40">He said to his disciples, "Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.41">They were terrified and asked each other, "Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!"</verse>

      <verse osisID="Mark.5.1">They went across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.2">When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an impure spirit came from the tombs to meet him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.3">This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.4">For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.5">Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.6">When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.7">He shouted at the top of his voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In God's name don't torture me!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.8">For Jesus had said to him, "Come out of this man, you impure spirit!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.9">Then Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" "My name is Legion," he replied, "for we are many."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.10">And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.11">A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.12">The demons begged Jesus, "Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.13">He gave them permission, and the impure spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.14">Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.15">When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.16">Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man—and told about the pigs as well.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.17">Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.18">As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.19">Jesus did not let him, but said, "Go home to your own people and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.20">So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis<note type="translation">The Greek word means "ten cities," referring to a region of ten Greek cities</note> how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Raises a Dead Girl and Heals a Sick Woman</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.21">When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.22">Then one of the synagogue leaders, named Jairus, came, and when he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.23">He pleaded earnestly with him, "My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.24">So Jesus went with him. A large crowd followed and pressed around him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.25">And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.26">She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.27">When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.28">because she thought, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.29">Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.30">At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who touched my clothes?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.31">"You see the people crowding against you," his disciples answered, "and yet you can ask, 'Who touched me?'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.32">But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.33">Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.34">He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.35">While Jesus was still speaking, some people came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. "Your daughter is dead," they said. "Why bother the teacher anymore?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.36">Overhearing what they said, Jesus told him, "Don't be afraid; just believe."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.37">He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.38">When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.39">He went in and said to them, "Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.40">But they laughed at him. After he put them all out, he took the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.41">He took her by the hand and said to her, "Talitha koum!"<note type="translation">Aramaic phrase meaning "Little girl, get up!"</note> (which means "Little girl, I say to you, get up!").</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.42">Immediately the girl stood up and began to walk around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.43">He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Mark.6" sID="Mark.6" />
      <title type="main">A Prophet Without Honor</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.1">Jesus left there and went to his hometown, accompanied by his disciples.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.2">When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed. "Where did this man get these things?" they asked. "What's this wisdom that has been given him? What are these remarkable miracles he is performing?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.3">Isn't this the carpenter? Isn't this Mary's son and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?" And they took offense at him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.4">Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.5">He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.6">He was amazed at their lack of faith. Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Sends Out the Twelve</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.7">Calling the Twelve to him, he began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over impure spirits.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.8">These were his instructions: "Take nothing for the journey except a staff—no bread, no bag, no money in your belts.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.9">Wear sandals but not an extra shirt.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.10">Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.11">And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, leave that place and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.12">They went out and preached that people should change their minds.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.13">They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.</verse>
      <title type="sub">John the Baptist Beheaded</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.14">King Herod heard about this, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some were saying, "John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.15">Others said, "He is Elijah." And still others claimed, "He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.16">But when Herod heard this, he said, "John, whom I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.17">For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.18">For John had been saying to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.19">So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.20">because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be in right standing with God and set apart man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled; yet he liked to listen to him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.21">Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.22">When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, "Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.23">And he promised her with an oath, "Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.24">She went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?" "The head of John the Baptist," she answered.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.25">At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.26">The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.27">So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.28">and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.29">On hearing of this, John's disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.30">The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.31">Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, "Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.32">So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.33">But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.34">When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.35">By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. "This is a remote place," they said, "and it's already very late.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.36">Send the people away so that they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.37">But he answered, "You give them something to eat." They said to him, "That would take more than half a year's wages<note type="translation">The Greek says "200 denarii," which was about 8 months' wages for a laborer</note>! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.38">"How many loaves do you have?" he asked. "Go and see." When they found out, they said, "Five—and two fish."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.39">Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.40">So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.41">Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people. He also divided the two fish among them all.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.42">They all ate and were satisfied,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.43">and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.44">The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Walks on the Water</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.45">Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.46">After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.47">Later that night, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.48">He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. Shortly before dawn he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to pass by them,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.49">but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They cried out,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.50">because they all saw him and were terrified. Immediately he spoke to them and said, "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.51">Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were completely amazed,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.52">for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.53">When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.54">As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized Jesus.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.55">They ran throughout that whole region and carried the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.6.56">And wherever he went—into villages, towns or countryside—they placed the sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.</verse>

      <title type="main">That Which Defiles</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.1">The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.2">and saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were defiled, that is, unwashed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.3">(The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.4">When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles.)</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.5">So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, "Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with defiled hands?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.6">He replied, "Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: 'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.7">They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.8">You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to human traditions."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.9">And he continued, "You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.10">For Moses said, 'Honor your father and mother,' and, 'Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.11">But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is Corban<note type="translation">The Aramaic word means "devoted to God" or a gift given to God</note> (that is, devoted to God)—</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.12">then you no longer let them do anything for their father or mother.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.13">Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.14">Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen to me, everyone, and understand this.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.15">Nothing outside a person can defile them by going into them. Rather, it is what comes out of a person that defiles them."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.17">After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.18">"Are you so dull?" he asked. "Don't you see that nothing that enters a person from the outside can defile them?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.19">For it doesn't go into their heart but into their stomach, and then out of the body." (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods clean.)</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.20">He went on: "What comes out of a person is what defiles them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.21">For it is from within, out of a person's heart, that evil thoughts come—sexual immorality, theft, murder,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.22">adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.23">All these evils come from inside and defile a person."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Honors a Syrophoenician Woman's Faith</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.24">Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.25">In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an impure spirit came and fell at his feet.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.26">The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.27">"First let the children eat all they want," he told her, "for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.28">"Lord," she replied, "even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.29">Then he told her, "For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.30">She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Heals a Deaf and Mute Man</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.31">Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.32">There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged Jesus to place his hand on him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.33">After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.34">He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, "Ephphatha!"<note type="translation">Aramaic word meaning "be opened"</note> (which means "Be opened!").</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.35">At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.36">Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.7.37">People were overwhelmed with amazement. "He has done everything well," they said. "He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak."</verse>
      <chapter eID="Mark.7" />
      <chapter osisID="Mark.8" sID="Mark.8" />
      <title type="main">Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.1">During those days another large crowd gathered. Since they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him and said,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.2">"I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.3">If I send them home hungry, they will collapse on the way, because some of them have come a long distance."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.4">His disciples answered, "But where in this remote place can anyone get enough bread to feed them?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.5">"How many loaves do you have?" Jesus asked. "Seven," they replied.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.6">He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. When he had taken the seven loaves and given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people, and they did so.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.7">They had a few small fish as well; he gave thanks for them also and told the disciples to distribute them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.8">The people ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.9">About four thousand were present. After he had sent them away,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.10">he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Demand for a Sign</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.11">The Pharisees came and began to question Jesus. To test him, they asked him for a sign from heaven.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.12">He sighed deeply and said, "Why does this generation ask for a sign? Truly I tell you, no sign will be given to it."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.13">Then he left them, got back into the boat and crossed to the other side.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Yeast of the Pharisees and Herod</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.14">The disciples had forgotten to bring bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.15">"Be careful," Jesus warned them. "Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and that of Herod."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.16">They discussed this with one another and said, "It is because we have no bread."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.17">Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them: "Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.18">Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear? And don't you remember?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.19">When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?" "Twelve," they replied.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.20">"And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?" They answered, "Seven."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.21">He said to them, "Do you still not understand?"</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Heals a Blind Man at Bethsaida</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.22">They came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.23">He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. When he had spit on the man's eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus asked, "Do you see anything?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.24">He looked up and said, "I see people; they look like trees walking around."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.25">Once more Jesus put his hands on the man's eyes. Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.26">Jesus sent him home, saying, "Don't even go into the village."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Peter Declares That Jesus Is the Messiah</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.27">Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked them, "Who do people say I am?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.28">They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.29">"But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?" Peter answered, "You are the Messiah."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.30">Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Predicts His Death</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.31">He then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and after three days rise again.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.32">He spoke plainly about this, and Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.33">But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter. "Get behind me, Satan!" he said. "You do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Way of the Cross</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.34">Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.35">For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me and for the gospel will save it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.36">What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.37">Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.8.38">If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his Father's glory with the set apart angels."</verse>

      <verse osisID="Mark.9.2">After six days Jesus took Peter, James and John with him and led them up a high mountain, where they were all alone. There he was transfigured before them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.3">His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.4">And there appeared before them Elijah and Moses, who were talking with Jesus.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.5">Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.6">(He did not know what to say, they were so frightened.)</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.7">Then a cloud appeared and covered them, and a voice came from the cloud: "This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.8">Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.9">As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.10">They kept the matter to themselves, discussing what "rising from the dead" meant.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Heals a Boy Possessed by an Impure Spirit</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.14">When they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Mark.9.23">"'If you can'?" said Jesus. "Everything is possible for one who believes."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.24">Immediately the boy's father exclaimed, "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.27">But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Predicts His Death a Second Time</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.31">because he was teaching his disciples. He said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise."</verse>

      <title type="main">Teaching About Divorce</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.1">Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Again crowds of people came to him, and as was his custom, he taught them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.2">Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.3">"What did Moses command you?" he replied.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.4">They said, "Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.5">"It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law," Jesus replied.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.6">"But at the beginning of creation God 'made them male and female.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.7">'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.8">and the two will become one flesh.' So they are no longer two, but one flesh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.9">Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.10">When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.11">He answered, "Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.12">And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Little Children and Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.13">People were bringing little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them, but the disciples rebuked them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.14">When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.15">Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.16">And he took the children in his arms, placed his hands on them and blessed them.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Rich Young Man</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.17">As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. "Good teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.18">"Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No one is good—except God alone.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.19">You know the commandments: 'You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, you shall not defraud, honor your father and mother.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.20">"Teacher," he declared, "all these I have kept since I was a boy."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.21">Jesus looked at him and loved him. "One thing you lack," he said. "Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.22">At this the man's face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.23">Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.24">The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, "Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.25">It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.26">The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, "Who then can be saved?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.27">Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.28">Then Peter spoke up, "We have left everything to follow you!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.29">"Truly I tell you," Jesus replied, "no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.30">will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age: homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields—along with persecutions—and in the age to come eternal life.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.31">But many who are first will be last, and the last first."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Predicts His Death a Third Time</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.32">They were on their way up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid. Again he took the Twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.33">"We are going up to Jerusalem," he said, "and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.34">who will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Request of James and John</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.35">Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. "Teacher," they said, "we want you to do for us whatever we ask."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.36">"What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.37">They replied, "Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.38">"You don't know what you are asking," Jesus said. "Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.39">"We can," they answered. Jesus said to them, "You will drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.40">but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.41">When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.42">Jesus called them together and said, "You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.43">Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.44">and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.45">For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Blind Bartimaeus Receives His Sight</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.46">Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (which means "son of Timaeus"), was sitting by the roadside begging.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.47">When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.48">Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.49">Jesus stopped and said, "Call him." So they called to the blind man, "Cheer up! On your feet! He's calling you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.50">Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.51">"What do you want me to do for you?" Jesus asked him. The blind man said, "Rabbi,<note type="translation">The Aramaic word "Rabboni" means "my teacher"</note> I want to see."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.52">"Go," said Jesus, "your faith has healed you." Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.</verse>

      <title type="main">Jesus Comes to Jerusalem as King</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.1">As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.2">saying to them, "Go to the village ahead of you, and just as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.3">If anyone asks you, 'Why are you doing this?' say, 'The Lord needs it and will send it back here shortly.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.4">They went and found a colt outside in the street, tied at a doorway. As they untied it,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.5">some people standing there asked, "What are you doing, untying that colt?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.6">They answered as Jesus had told them to, and the people let them go.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.7">When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, he sat on it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.8">Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut in the fields.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.9">Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, "Hosanna!<note type="translation">A Hebrew expression meaning "Save!" which became an exclamation of praise</note> Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.10">"Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest heaven!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.11">Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Curses a Fig Tree and Clears the Temple Courts</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.12">The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.13">Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.14">Then he said to the tree, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again." And his disciples heard him say it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.15">On reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple courts and began driving out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.16">and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.17">And as he taught them, he said, "Is it not written: 'My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations'? But you have made it 'a den of robbers.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.18">The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him, for they feared him, because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.19">When evening came, Jesus and his disciples went out of the city.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.20">In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.21">Peter remembered and said to Jesus, "Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.22">"Have faith in God," Jesus answered.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.23">"Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them.</verse>

      <title type="sub">The Authority of Jesus Questioned</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.27">They arrived again in Jerusalem, and while Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders came to him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.28">"By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you authority to do this?"</verse>

      <verse osisID="Mark.11.30">John's baptism—was it from heaven, or of human origin? Tell me!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.31">They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.32">But if we say, 'Of human origin'..." (They feared the people, for everyone held that John really was a prophet.)</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.11.33">So they answered Jesus, "We don't know." Jesus said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things."</verse>

      <verse osisID="Mark.12.1">He began to speak to them in parables: "A man planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug out a wine vat, built a tower, rented it to tenants, and went away on a journey.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.2">At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the vineyard's fruit.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.3">But they seized him, beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.4">Again he sent another servant to them, and they struck him on the head and treated him shamefully.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.5">He sent yet another, and that one they killed. Many others he sent—some they beat, others they killed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.6">He still had one left, a beloved son. He sent him to them last, saying, 'They will respect my son.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.7">But those tenants said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.8">So they took him, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.9">What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.10">Haven't you read this Scripture: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.11">This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.12">They looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had spoken the parable against them. But they were afraid of the crowd, so they left him and went away.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Paying Taxes to Caesar</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.13">Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to trap him with his words.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.14">They came and said to him, "Teacher, we know that you are truthful and don't care what anyone thinks, for you don't show favoritism to people, but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it lawful to pay the poll tax to Caesar or not? Should we pay or shouldn't we?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.15">Knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, "Why are you testing me? Bring me a denarius<note type="translation">A denarius was worth about a day's wage for a laborer</note> and let me look at it."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.16">They brought the coin, and he asked them, "Whose image and inscription is this?" "Caesar's," they replied.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.17">Then Jesus said to them, "Give back to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's." And they were amazed at him.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Marriage at the Resurrection</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.18">Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.19">"Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.20">Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died without leaving any children.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.21">The second one married the widow, but he also died, leaving no child. It was the same with the third.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.22">In fact, none of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman died too.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.23">At the resurrection when they rise, whose wife will she be, since the seven were all married to her?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.24">Jesus replied, "Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.25">When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.26">Now about the dead rising—have you not read in the Book of Moses, in the account of the burning bush, how God said to him, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.27">He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!"</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Greatest Commandment</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.28">One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, "Of all the commandments, which is the most important?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.29">"The most important one," answered Jesus, "is this: 'Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.30">Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.31">The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.32">"Well said, teacher," the man replied. "You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.33">To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.34">When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Whose Son Is the Messiah?</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.35">While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, "Why do the teachers of the law say that the Messiah<note type="translation">Greek word "Christ" means "Anointed One" or "Messiah"</note> is the son of David?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.36">David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: "'The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.37">David himself calls him 'Lord.' How then can he be his son?" The large crowd listened to him with delight.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Warning Against the Teachers of the Law</title>

      <verse osisID="Mark.14.59">Yet even then their testimony did not agree.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.14.60">Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, "Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.14.61">But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.14.62">"I am," said Jesus. "And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.14.63">The high priest tore his clothes. "Why do we need any more witnesses?" he asked.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Mark.14.70">Again he denied it. After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, "Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean."</verse>
