      <title type="main">John the Baptist Prepares the Way</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.1">The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah<note type="translation">The Greek word "Christ" means "Anointed One" or "Messiah"</note>, the Son of God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.2">It is written in Isaiah the prophet: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way"—</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.3">"a voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.4">And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of changed minds<note type="translation">The Greek word "metanoia" means changing one's mind or way of thinking</note> for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.5">The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.6">John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.7">And this was his message: "After me comes the one more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.8">I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit<note type="translation">The Greek phrase means "Spirit that is set apart for God"</note>."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Baptism and Testing of Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.9">At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.10">Just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.11">And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.12">At once the Spirit sent him out into the wilderness,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.13">and he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Announces the Good News</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.14">After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.15">"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God has come near. Change your minds and believe the good news!"</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Calls the First Disciples</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.16">As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.17">"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will send you out to fish for people."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.18">At once they left their nets and followed him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.19">When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.20">Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Drives Out an Impure Spirit</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.21">They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.22">The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.23">Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an impure spirit cried out,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.24">"What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the One Set Apart by God<note type="translation">The Greek phrase "ho hagios tou theou" means the one set apart by God</note>!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.25">"Be quiet!" said Jesus sternly. "Come out of him!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.26">The impure spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.27">The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching—and with authority! He even gives orders to impure spirits and they obey him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.28">News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Heals Many</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.29">As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.30">Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they immediately told Jesus about her.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.31">So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.32">That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.33">The whole town gathered at the door,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.34">and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Prays in a Solitary Place</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.35">Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.36">Simon and his companions went to look for him,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.37">and when they found him, they exclaimed: "Everyone is looking for you!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.38">Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages—so I can preach there also. That is why I have come."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.39">So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Heals a Man With Leprosy</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.40">A man with leprosy<note type="translation">The Greek word can refer to various skin diseases</note> came to him and begged him on his knees, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.41">Jesus was indignant. He reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.42">Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.43">Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.44">"See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.45">Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.</verse>
