      <chapter osisID="Mark.1" sID="Mark.1"/>
      <title type="main">John the Baptist Prepares the Way</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.1">The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah<note type="translation">The Greek word "Christ" means "Anointed One" or "Messiah"</note>, the Son of God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.2">It is written in Isaiah the prophet: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way"—</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.3">"a voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.4">And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of changed minds<note type="translation">The Greek word "metanoia" means changing one's mind or way of thinking</note> for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.5">The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.6">John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.7">And this was his message: "After me comes the one more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.8">I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit<note type="translation">The Greek phrase means "Spirit that is set apart for God"</note>."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Baptism and Testing of Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.9">At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.10">Just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.11">And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.12">At once the Spirit sent him out into the wilderness,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.13">and he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Announces the Good News</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.14">After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.15">"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God has come near. Change your minds and believe the good news!"</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Calls the First Disciples</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.16">As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.17">"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will send you out to fish for people."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.18">At once they left their nets and followed him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.19">When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.20">Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Drives Out an Impure Spirit</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.21">They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.22">The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.23">Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an impure spirit cried out,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.24">"What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the One Set Apart by God<note type="translation">The Greek phrase "ho hagios tou theou" means the one set apart by God</note>!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.25">"Be quiet!" said Jesus sternly. "Come out of him!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.26">The impure spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.27">The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching—and with authority! He even gives orders to impure spirits and they obey him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.28">News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Heals Many</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.29">As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.30">Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they immediately told Jesus about her.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.31">So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.32">That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.33">The whole town gathered at the door,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.34">and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Prays in a Solitary Place</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.35">Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.36">Simon and his companions went to look for him,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.37">and when they found him, they exclaimed: "Everyone is looking for you!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.38">Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages—so I can preach there also. That is why I have come."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.39">So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Heals a Man With Leprosy</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.40">A man with leprosy<note type="translation">The Greek word can refer to various skin diseases</note> came to him and begged him on his knees, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.41">Jesus was indignant. He reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.42">Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.43">Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.44">"See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.45">Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.</verse>
      <chapter eID="Mark.1"/>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.2" sID="Mark.2"/>
      <title type="main">Jesus Heals a Paralyzed Man</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.1">A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.2">They gathered in such large numbers that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.3">Some men came, bringing to him a paralyzed man, carried by four of them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.4">Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging through it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.5">When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.6">Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.7">"Why does this fellow talk like that? He's insulting God<note type="translation">The Greek word "blasphemeo" means to insult or speak against the sacred</note>! Who can forgive sins but God alone?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.8">Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.9">Which is easier: to say to this paralyzed man, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take your mat and walk'?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.10">But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." So he said to the man,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.11">"I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.12">He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!"</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Calls Levi and Eats With Tax Collectors</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.13">Once again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.14">As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.15">While Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.16">When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.17">On hearing this, Jesus said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the upright, but sinners."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Questioned About Fasting</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.18">Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and asked Jesus, "How is it that John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.19">Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.20">But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.21">"No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.22">And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.23">One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.24">The Pharisees said to him, "Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.25">He answered, "Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.26">In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread<note type="translation">The Greek phrase "bread of the presence" refers to twelve loaves placed before God</note>, which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.27">Then he said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.28">So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."</verse>
      <chapter eID="Mark.2"/>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.3" sID="Mark.3"/>
      <title type="main">Jesus Heals on the Sabbath</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.1">Another time Jesus went into the synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.2">Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.3">Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand, "Stand up in front of everyone."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.4">Then Jesus asked them, "Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?" But they remained silent.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.5">He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.6">Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Crowds Follow Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.7">Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake, and a large crowd from Galilee followed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.8">When they heard about all he was doing, many people came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and the regions across the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.9">Because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, to keep the people from crowding him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.10">For he had healed many, so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.11">Whenever the impure spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, "You are the Son of God!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.12">But he gave them strict orders not to tell others about him.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Appoints the Twelve Apostles</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.13">Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.14">He appointed twelve that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.15">and to have authority to drive out demons.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.16">These are the twelve he appointed: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter),</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.17">James son of Zebedee and his brother John (to them he gave the name Boanerges, which means "sons of thunder"),</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.18">Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.19">and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Accused by His Family and by Teachers of the Law</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.20">Then Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.21">When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, "He is out of his mind."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.22">And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul<note type="translation">A name for Satan meaning "lord of flies"</note>! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.23">So Jesus called them over to him and began to speak to them in parables: "How can Satan drive out Satan?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.24">If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.25">If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.26">And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.27">In fact, no one can enter a strong man's house without first tying him up. Then he can plunder the strong man's house.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.28">Truly I tell you, people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.29">but whoever insults the Holy Spirit will never have forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.30">He said this because they were saying, "He has an impure spirit."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus' Mother and Brothers</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.31">Then Jesus' mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.32">A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, "Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.33">"Who are my mother and my brothers?" he asked.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.34">Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said, "Here are my mother and my brothers!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.3.35">Whoever does God's will is my brother and sister and mother."</verse>
      <chapter eID="Mark.3"/>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.4" sID="Mark.4"/>
      <title type="main">The Parable of the Sower</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.1">Again Jesus began to teach by the lake. The crowd that gathered around him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake, while all the people were along the shore at the water's edge.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.2">He taught them many things by parables, and in his teaching said:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.3">"Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.4">As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.5">Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.6">But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.7">Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.8">Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced a crop, some multiplying thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.9">Then Jesus said, "Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.10">When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.11">He told them, "The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.12">so that, 'they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.13">Then Jesus said to them, "Don't you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.14">The farmer sows the word.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.15">Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.16">Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.17">But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.18">Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.19">but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.20">Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop—some thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times what was sown."</verse>
      <title type="sub">A Lamp on a Stand</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.21">He said to them, "Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed? Instead, don't you put it on its stand?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.22">For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.23">If anyone has ears to hear, let them hear."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.24">"Consider carefully what you hear," he continued. "With the measure you use, it will be measured to you—and even more.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.25">Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Parable of the Growing Seed</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.26">He also said, "This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.27">Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.28">All by itself the soil produces grain—first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.29">As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Parable of the Mustard Seed</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.30">Again he said, "What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what parable shall we use to describe it?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.31">It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds on earth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.32">Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds can perch in its shade."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.33">With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.34">He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Calms the Storm</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.35">That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, "Let us go over to the other side."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.36">Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.37">A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.38">Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, "Teacher, don't you care if we drown?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.39">He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, "Quiet! Be still!" Then the wind died down and it was completely calm.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.40">He said to his disciples, "Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.4.41">They were terrified and asked each other, "Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!"</verse>
      <chapter eID="Mark.4"/>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.5" sID="Mark.5"/>
      <title type="main">Jesus Restores a Demon-Possessed Man</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.1">They went across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.2">When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an impure spirit came from the tombs to meet him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.3">This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.4">For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.5">Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.6">When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.7">He shouted at the top of his voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In God's name don't torture me!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.8">For Jesus had said to him, "Come out of this man, you impure spirit!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.9">Then Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" "My name is Legion," he replied, "for we are many."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.10">And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.11">A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.12">The demons begged Jesus, "Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.13">He gave them permission, and the impure spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.14">Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.15">When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.16">Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man—and told about the pigs as well.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.17">Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.18">As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.19">Jesus did not let him, but said, "Go home to your own people and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.20">So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis<note type="translation">The Greek word means "ten cities," referring to a region of ten Greek cities</note> how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Mark.5.21">When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.22">Then one of the synagogue leaders, named Jairus, came, and when he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.23">He pleaded earnestly with him, "My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.24">So Jesus went with him. A large crowd followed and pressed around him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.25">And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.26">She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.27">When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.28">because she thought, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.29">Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.30">At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who touched my clothes?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.31">"You see the people crowding against you," his disciples answered, "and yet you can ask, 'Who touched me?'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.32">But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.33">Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.34">He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.35">While Jesus was still speaking, some people came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. "Your daughter is dead," they said. "Why bother the teacher anymore?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.36">Overhearing what they said, Jesus told him, "Don't be afraid; just believe."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.37">He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.38">When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.39">He went in and said to them, "Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.40">But they laughed at him. After he put them all out, he took the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.41">He took her by the hand and said to her, "Talitha koum!"<note type="translation">Aramaic phrase meaning "Little girl, get up!"</note> (which means "Little girl, I say to you, get up!").</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.42">Immediately the girl stood up and began to walk around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.5.43">He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.</verse>
