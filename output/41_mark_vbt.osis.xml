      <chapter osisID="Mark.1" sID="Mark.1"/>
      <title type="main">John the Baptist Prepares the Way</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.1">The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah<note type="translation">The Greek word "Christ" means "Anointed One" or "Messiah"</note>, the Son of God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.2">It is written in Isaiah the prophet: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way"—</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.3">"a voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.4">And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of changed minds<note type="translation">The Greek word "metanoia" means changing one's mind or way of thinking</note> for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.5">The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.6">John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.7">And this was his message: "After me comes the one more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.8">I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit<note type="translation">The Greek phrase means "Spirit that is set apart for God"</note>."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Baptism and Testing of Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.9">At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.10">Just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.11">And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.12">At once the Spirit sent him out into the wilderness,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.13">and he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Announces the Good News</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.14">After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.15">"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God has come near. Change your minds and believe the good news!"</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Calls the First Disciples</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.16">As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.17">"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will send you out to fish for people."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.18">At once they left their nets and followed him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.19">When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.20">Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Drives Out an Impure Spirit</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.21">They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.22">The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.23">Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an impure spirit cried out,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.24">"What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the One Set Apart by God<note type="translation">The Greek phrase "ho hagios tou theou" means the one set apart by God</note>!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.25">"Be quiet!" said Jesus sternly. "Come out of him!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.26">The impure spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.27">The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching—and with authority! He even gives orders to impure spirits and they obey him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.28">News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Heals Many</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.29">As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.30">Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they immediately told Jesus about her.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.31">So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.32">That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.33">The whole town gathered at the door,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.34">and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Prays in a Solitary Place</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.35">Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.36">Simon and his companions went to look for him,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.37">and when they found him, they exclaimed: "Everyone is looking for you!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.38">Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages—so I can preach there also. That is why I have come."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.39">So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Heals a Man With Leprosy</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.40">A man with leprosy<note type="translation">The Greek word can refer to various skin diseases</note> came to him and begged him on his knees, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.41">Jesus was indignant. He reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.42">Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.43">Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.44">"See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.1.45">Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.</verse>
      <chapter eID="Mark.1"/>
      <chapter osisID="Mark.2" sID="Mark.2"/>
      <title type="main">Jesus Heals a Paralyzed Man</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.1">A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.2">They gathered in such large numbers that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.3">Some men came, bringing to him a paralyzed man, carried by four of them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.4">Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging through it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.5">When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.6">Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.7">"Why does this fellow talk like that? He's insulting God<note type="translation">The Greek word "blasphemeo" means to insult or speak against the sacred</note>! Who can forgive sins but God alone?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.8">Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.9">Which is easier: to say to this paralyzed man, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take your mat and walk'?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.10">But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." So he said to the man,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.11">"I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.12">He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!"</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Calls Levi and Eats With Tax Collectors</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.13">Once again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.14">As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.15">While Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.16">When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.17">On hearing this, Jesus said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the upright, but sinners."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Questioned About Fasting</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.18">Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and asked Jesus, "How is it that John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.19">Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.20">But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.21">"No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.22">And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.23">One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.24">The Pharisees said to him, "Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.25">He answered, "Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.26">In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread<note type="translation">The Greek phrase "bread of the presence" refers to twelve loaves placed before God</note>, which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.27">Then he said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.2.28">So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."</verse>
