        <verse osisID="Joel.2.1">Blow the horn in Zion; sound the alarm on my set apart mountain! Let all the residents of the land tremble, for the day of Yahweh is coming; it is near—</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Joel.2.2">a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and total darkness, like dawn spreading over the mountains. A great and mighty army comes, such as never was from ancient times, and never will be again through the years of many generations.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Joel.2.3">Fire devours in front of them, and behind them a flame burns. The land in front of them is like the garden of Eden, but behind them, it becomes a desolate wilderness. Nothing at all escapes them.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Joel.2.5">They bound on the tops of the mountains. Listen! The sound is like rumbling chariots, like crackling fire consuming stubble, like a mighty army lined up for battle.</verse>

Let them say: "Have pity on your people, Yahweh, and do not make your inheritance a disgrace, an object of scorn among the nations. Why should it be said among the peoples, 'Where is their God?'"</verse>

        <verse osisID="Joel.2.20">I will drive the northern army far from you and banish it to a dry and desolate land, its front ranks to the eastern sea, and its rear guard to the western sea. Its stench will rise; its stink will go up, for it has done great things."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Joel.2.21">Don't be afraid, land; rejoice and be glad, for Yahweh has done great things.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Joel.2.22">Don't be afraid, wild animals, for the pastures of the wilderness have turned green, the trees bear their fruit, and the fig tree and grapevine yield their riches.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Joel.2.23">Children of Zion, rejoice and be glad in Yahweh your God, because he gives you the autumn rain for your vindication. He sends showers for you—both autumn and spring rain as before.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Joel.2.28">"After this I will pour out my Spirit on all humanity. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will have dreams, and your young men will see visions.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Joel.2.29">I will even pour out my Spirit on the male and female servants in those days.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Joel.2.30">I will display wonders in the heavens and on the earth: blood, fire, and columns of smoke.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Joel.2.31">The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the great and awesome day of Yahweh comes.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Joel.2.32">Then everyone who calls on the name of Yahweh will be saved, for there will be an escape for those on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, as Yahweh promised, among the survivors Yahweh calls.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Joel.3.2">I will gather all the nations and take them to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. I will enter into judgment with them there because of my people, my inheritance Israel. The nations have scattered my people among the countries and divided up my land.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Joel.3.3">They cast lots for my people; they traded boys for prostitutes and sold girls for wine to drink.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Joel.3.4">"And also, Tyre, Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia—what are you to me? Are you paying me back or trying to get even with me? I will quickly bring your actions back on your own heads.</verse>
