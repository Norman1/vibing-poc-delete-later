      <title type="sub">David Learns of Saul's Death</title>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.1.1">After the death of Saul, David returned from striking down the Amalekites and stayed in Ziklag two days.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.1.2">On the third day a man arrived from Saul's camp with his clothes torn and dust on his head. When he came to David, he fell to the ground to pay him honor.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.1.3">"Where have you come from?" David asked him. He answered, "I have escaped from the Israelite camp."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.1.4">"What happened?" David asked. "Tell me." "The men fled from the battle," he replied. "Many of them fell and died. And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.1.5">Then David said to the young man who brought him the report, "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.1.6">"I happened to be on Mount Gilboa," the young man said, "and there was Saul, leaning on his spear, with the chariots and their drivers in hot pursuit.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.1.7">When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me, and I said, 'What can I do?'</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.1.8">"He asked me, 'Who are you?' 'An Amalekite,' I answered.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.1.9">Then he said to me, 'Stand here by me and kill me! I'm in the throes of death, but I'm still alive.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.1.10">So I stood beside him and killed him, because I knew that after he had fallen he could not survive. And I took the crown that was on his head and the band on his arm and have brought them here to my lord."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.1.11">Then David and all the men with him took hold of their clothes and tore them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.1.12">They mourned and wept and fasted till evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the army of Yahweh and for the nation of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.1.13">David said to the young man who brought him the report, "Where are you from?" "I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite," he answered.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.1.14">David asked him, "Why weren't you afraid to lift your hand to destroy Yahweh's anointed one?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.1.15">Then David called one of his men and said, "Go, strike him down!" So he struck him down and he died.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.1.16">For David had said to him, "Your blood be on your own head. Your own mouth testified against you when you said, 'I killed Yahweh's anointed one.'"</verse>

      <title type="sub">David's Lament for Saul and Jonathan</title>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.1.17">David took up this lament concerning Saul and his son Jonathan,</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.1.18">and he ordered that the people of Judah be taught this lament of the bow (it is written in the Book of Jashar):</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.1.19">"A gazelle lies slain on your heights, Israel. How the mighty have fallen!</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.1.20">Tell it not in Gath, proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines be glad, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised rejoice.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.1.21">Mountains of Gilboa, may you have neither dew nor rain, may no showers fall on your terraced fields. For there the shield of the mighty was despised, the shield of Saul—no longer rubbed with oil.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.1.22">From the blood of the slain, from the flesh of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, the sword of Saul did not return unsatisfied.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.1.23">Saul and Jonathan— in life they were loved and admired, and in death they were not parted. They were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.1.24">Daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you in scarlet and finery, who adorned your garments with ornaments of gold.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.1.25">How the mighty have fallen in battle! Jonathan lies slain on your heights.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.1.26">I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother; you were very dear to me. Your love for me was wonderful, more wonderful than that of women.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.1.27">How the mighty have fallen! The weapons of war have perished!"</verse>

      <title type="sub">David Anointed King Over Judah</title>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.1">In the course of time, David inquired of Yahweh. "Shall I go up to one of the towns of Judah?" he asked. Yahweh said, "Go up." David asked, "Where shall I go?" "To Hebron," Yahweh answered.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.2">So David went up there with his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.3">David also took the men who were with him, each with his family, and they settled in Hebron and its towns.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.4">Then the men of Judah came to Hebron, and there they anointed David king over the tribe of Judah. When David was told that it was the men of Jabesh Gilead who had buried Saul,</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.5">he sent messengers to them to say, "Yahweh bless you for showing this kindness to Saul your master by burying him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.6">May Yahweh now show you kindness and faithfulness, and I too will show you the same favor because you have done this.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.7">Now then, be strong and brave, for Saul your master is dead, and the people of Judah have anointed me king over them."</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">War Between the Houses of David and Saul</title>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.8">Meanwhile, Abner son of Ner, the commander of Saul's army, had taken Ish-Bosheth son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.9">He made him king over Gilead, Ashuri and Jezreel, and also over Ephraim, Benjamin and all Israel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.10">Ish-Bosheth son of Saul was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he reigned two years. The tribe of Judah, however, remained loyal to David.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.11">The length of time David was king in Hebron over Judah was seven years and six months.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.12">Abner son of Ner, together with the men of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, left Mahanaim and went to Gibeon.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.13">Joab son of Zeruiah and David's men went out and met them at the pool of Gibeon. One group sat down on one side of the pool and one group on the other side.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.14">Then Abner said to Joab, "Let's have some of the young men get up and fight hand to hand in front of us." "All right, let them do it," Joab said.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.15">So they stood up and were counted off—twelve men for Benjamin and Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, and twelve for David.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.16">Then each man grabbed his opponent by the head and thrust his dagger into his opponent's side, and they fell down together. So that place in Gibeon was called Helkath Hazzurim.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.17">The battle that day was very fierce, and Abner and the Israelites were defeated by David's men.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.18">The three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai and Asahel. Now Asahel was as fleet-footed as a wild gazelle.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.19">He pursued Abner, turning neither to the right nor to the left as he followed him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.20">Abner looked behind him and asked, "Is that you, Asahel?" "It is," he answered.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.21">Then Abner said to him, "Turn aside to the right or to the left; take on one of the young men and strip him of his weapons." But Asahel would not stop chasing him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.22">Again Abner warned Asahel, "Stop chasing me! Why should I strike you down? How could I look your brother Joab in the face?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.23">But Asahel refused to give up the pursuit; so Abner thrust the butt of his spear into Asahel's stomach, and the spear came out through his back. He fell there and died on the spot. And every man stopped when he came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.24">But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner, and as the sun was setting, they came to the hill of Ammah, near Giah on the way to the wasteland of Gibeon.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.25">Then the men of Benjamin rallied behind Abner. They formed themselves into a group and took their stand on top of a hill.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.26">Abner called out to Joab, "Must the sword devour forever? Don't you realize that this will end in bitterness? How long before you order your men to stop pursuing their fellow Israelites?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.27">Joab answered, "As surely as God lives, if you had not spoken, the men would have continued pursuing their fellow Israelites until morning."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.28">So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the troops came to a halt; they no longer pursued Israel, nor did they fight anymore.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.29">All that night Abner and his men marched through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, continued through the morning hours and came to Mahanaim.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.30">Then Joab stopped pursuing Abner and assembled the whole army. Besides Asahel, nineteen of David's men were found missing.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.31">But David's men had killed three hundred and sixty Benjamites who were with Abner.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.2.32">They took Asahel and buried him in his father's tomb at Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men marched all night and arrived at Hebron by daybreak.</verse>

      <title type="sub">Abner Defects to David</title>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.1">The war between the house of Saul and the house of David lasted a long time. David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.2">Sons were born to David in Hebron: His firstborn was Amnon the son of Ahinoam of Jezreel;</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.3">his second, Kileab the son of Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel; the third, Absalom the son of Maakah daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.4">the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.5">and the sixth, Ithream the son of David's wife Eglah. These were born to David in Hebron.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.6">During the war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner had been strengthening his own position in the house of Saul.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.7">Now Saul had had a concubine named Rizpah daughter of Aiah. And Ish-Bosheth said to Abner, "Why did you sleep with my father's concubine?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.8">Abner was very angry because of what Ish-Bosheth said. So he answered, "Am I a dog's head—on Judah's side? This very day I am loyal to the house of your father Saul and to his family and friends. I haven't handed you over to David. Yet now you accuse me of an offense involving this woman!</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.9">May God deal with Abner, be it ever so severely, if I do not do for David what Yahweh promised him on oath</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.10">and transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and establish David's throne over Israel and Judah from Dan to Beersheba."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.11">Ish-Bosheth did not dare to say another word to Abner, because he was afraid of him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.12">Then Abner sent messengers on his behalf to say to David, "Whose land is it? Make an agreement with me, and I will help you bring all Israel over to you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.13">"Good," said David. "I will make an agreement with you. But I demand one thing of you: Do not come into my presence unless you bring Michal daughter of Saul when you come to see me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.14">Then David sent messengers to Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, demanding, "Give me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for the price of a hundred Philistine foreskins."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.15">So Ish-Bosheth gave orders and had her taken away from her husband Paltiel son of Laish.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.16">Her husband, however, went with her, weeping behind her all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, "Go back home!" So he went back.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.17">Abner conferred with the elders of Israel and said, "For some time you have wanted to make David your king.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.18">Now do it! For Yahweh promised David, 'By my servant David I will rescue my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.19">Abner also spoke to the Benjamites in person. Then he went to Hebron to tell David everything that Israel and the whole tribe of Benjamin wanted to do.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.20">When Abner, who had twenty men with him, came to David at Hebron, David prepared a feast for him and his men.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.21">Then Abner said to David, "Let me go at once and assemble all Israel for my lord the king, so that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may rule over all that your heart desires." So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.</verse>

      <title type="sub">Joab Murders Abner</title>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.22">Just then David's men and Joab returned from a raid and brought with them a great deal of plunder. But Abner was no longer with David in Hebron, because David had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.23">When Joab and all the soldiers with him arrived, he was told that Abner son of Ner had come to the king and that the king had sent him away and he had gone in peace.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.24">So Joab went to the king and said, "What have you done? Look, Abner came to you. Why did you let him go? Now he is gone!</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.25">You know Abner son of Ner; he came to deceive you and observe your movements and find out everything you are doing."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.26">Joab then left David and sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the cistern at Sirah. But David did not know it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.27">Now when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into an inner chamber, as if to speak with him privately. And there, to avenge the blood of his brother Asahel, Joab stabbed him in the stomach, and he died.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.28">Later, when David heard about this, he said, "I and my kingdom are forever innocent before Yahweh concerning the blood of Abner son of Ner.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.29">May his blood fall on the head of Joab and on his whole family! May Joab's family never be without someone who has a running sore or leprosy or who leans on a crutch or who falls by the sword or who lacks food."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.30">(Joab and his brother Abishai murdered Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.)</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.31">Then David said to Joab and all the people with him, "Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth and walk in mourning in front of Abner." King David himself walked behind the bier.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.32">They buried Abner in Hebron, and the king wept aloud at Abner's tomb. All the people wept also.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.33">The king sang this lament for Abner: "Should Abner have died as the lawless die?</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.34">Your hands were not bound, your feet were not fettered. You fell as one falls before the wicked." And all the people wept over him again.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.35">Then they all came and urged David to eat something while it was still day; but David took an oath, saying, "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun sets!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.36">All the people took note and were pleased; indeed, everything the king did pleased them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.37">So on that day all the people there and all Israel knew that the king had no part in the murder of Abner son of Ner.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.38">Then the king said to his men, "Do you not realize that a commander and a great man has fallen in Israel this day?</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.3.39">And today, though I am the anointed king, I am weak, and these sons of Zeruiah are too strong for me. May Yahweh repay the evildoer according to his evil deeds!"</verse>

      <title type="sub">Ish-Bosheth Murdered</title>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.4.1">When Ish-Bosheth son of Saul heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he lost courage, and all Israel became alarmed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.4.2">Now Saul's son had two men who were leaders of raiding bands. One was named Baanah and the other Rekab; they were sons of Rimmon the Beerothite from the tribe of Benjamin—Beeroth is considered part of Benjamin,</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.4.3">because the people of Beeroth fled to Gittaim and have resided there as foreigners to this day.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.4.4">(Jonathan son of Saul had a son who was lame in both feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled, but as she hurried to leave, he fell and became disabled. His name was Mephibosheth.)</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.4.5">Now Rekab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, set out for the house of Ish-Bosheth, and they arrived there in the heat of the day while he was taking his noonday rest.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.4.6">They went into the inner part of the house as if to get some wheat, and they stabbed him in the stomach. Then Rekab and his brother Baanah slipped away.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.4.7">They had gone into the house while he was lying on the bed in his bedroom. After they stabbed and killed him, they cut off his head. Taking it with them, they traveled all night by way of the Arabah.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.4.8">They brought the head of Ish-Bosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king, "Here is the head of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, your enemy, who tried to kill you. This day Yahweh has avenged my lord the king against Saul and his offspring."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.4.9">David answered Rekab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, "As surely as Yahweh lives, who has delivered me out of every trouble,</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.4.10">when someone told me, 'Saul is dead,' and thought he was bringing good news, I seized him and put him to death in Ziklag. That was the reward I gave him for his news!</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.4.11">How much more—when wicked men have killed an innocent man in his own house and on his own bed—should I not now demand his blood from your hand and rid the earth of you!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.4.12">So David gave an order to his men, and they killed them. They cut off their hands and feet and hung the bodies by the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-Bosheth and buried it in Abner's tomb at Hebron.</verse>

      <title type="sub">David Becomes King Over Israel</title>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.5.1">All the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, "We are your own flesh and blood.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.5.2">In the past, while Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel on their military campaigns. And Yahweh said to you, 'You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become their ruler.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.5.3">When all the elders of Israel had come to King David at Hebron, the king made a covenant with them at Hebron before Yahweh, and they anointed David king over Israel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.5.4">David was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.5.5">In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years.</verse>

      <title type="sub">David Conquers Jerusalem</title>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.5.6">The king and his men marched to Jerusalem to attack the Jebusites, who lived there. The Jebusites said to David, "You will not get in here; even the blind and the lame can ward you off." They thought, "David cannot get in here."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.5.7">Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion—which is the City of David.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.5.8">On that day David had said, "Anyone who conquers the Jebusites will have to use the water shaft to reach those 'lame and blind' who are David's enemies." That is why they say, "The 'blind and lame' will not enter the palace."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.5.9">David then took up residence in the fortress and called it the City of David. He built up the area around it, from the terraces inward.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.5.10">And he became more and more powerful, because Yahweh God Almighty was with him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.5.11">Now Hiram king of Tyre sent envoys to David, along with cedar logs and carpenters and stonemasons, and they built a palace for David.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.5.12">Then David knew that Yahweh had established him as king over Israel and had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.5.13">After he left Hebron, David took more concubines and wives in Jerusalem, and more sons and daughters were born to him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.5.14">These are the names of the children born to him there: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.5.15">Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.5.16">Elishama, Eliada and Eliphelet.</verse>

      <title type="sub">David Defeats the Philistines</title>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.5.17">When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, they went up in full force to search for him, but David heard about it and went down to the stronghold.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.5.18">Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim;</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.5.19">so David inquired of Yahweh, "Shall I go and attack the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hands?" Yahweh answered him, "Go, for I will surely deliver the Philistines into your hands."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.5.20"><note type="study" n="1">Baal Perazim means "lord of breaking through."</note>So David went to Baal Perazim, and there he defeated them. He said, "As waters break out, Yahweh has broken out against my enemies before me." So that place was called Baal Perazim.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.5.21">The Philistines abandoned their idols there, and David and his men carried them off.</verse>

      <verse osisID="2Sam.10.3">the Ammonite commanders said to Hanun their lord, "Do you think David is honoring your father by sending envoys to you to express sympathy? Hasn't David sent them to you only to explore the city and spy it out and overthrow it?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.10.4">So Hanun seized David's envoys, shaved off half of each man's beard, cut off their garments at the buttocks, and sent them away.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.10.5">When David was told about this, he sent messengers to meet the men, for they were greatly humiliated. The king said, "Stay at Jericho till your beards have grown, and then come back."</verse>

      <verse osisID="2Sam.10.7">On hearing this, David sent Joab out with the entire army of fighting men.</verse>

      <verse osisID="2Sam.10.16">Hadadezer had Arameans brought from beyond the Euphrates River; they went to Helam, with Shobach the commander of Hadadezer's army leading them.</verse>

      <verse osisID="2Sam.12.5">David burned with anger against the man and said to Nathan, "As surely as Yahweh lives, the man who did this must die!</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.12.6">He must pay for that lamb four times over, because he did such a thing and had no pity."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.12.7">Then Nathan said to David, "You are the man! This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: 'I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.12.8">I gave your master's house to you, and your master's wives into your arms. I gave you all Israel and Judah. And if all this had been too little, I would have given you even more.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.12.9">Why did you despise the word of Yahweh by doing what is evil in his eyes? You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and took his wife to be your own. You killed him with the sword of the Ammonites.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.12.10">Now, therefore, the sword will never depart from your house, because you despised me and took the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.12.11">This is what Yahweh says: 'Out of your own household I am going to bring calamity on you. Before your very eyes I will take your wives and give them to one who is close to you, and he will sleep with your wives in broad daylight.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.12.12">You did it in secret, but I will do this thing in broad daylight before all Israel.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.12.13">Then David said to Nathan, "I have wronged Yahweh." Nathan replied, "Yahweh has taken away your wrong doing. You are not going to die.</verse>

      <verse osisID="2Sam.12.15">After Nathan had gone home, Yahweh struck the child that Uriah's wife had borne to David, and he became ill.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.12.16">David pleaded with God for the child. He fasted and spent the nights lying in sackcloth on the ground.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.12.17">The elders of his household stood beside him to get him up from the ground, but he refused, and he would not eat any food with them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.12.18">On the seventh day the child died. David's attendants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they thought, "While the child was still living, he wouldn't listen to us when we spoke to him. How can we now tell him the child is dead? He may do something desperate."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.12.19">David noticed that his attendants were whispering among themselves, and he realized the child was dead. "Is the child dead?" he asked. "Yes," they replied, "he is dead."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.12.20">Then David got up from the ground. After he had washed, put on lotions and changed his clothes, he went into the house of Yahweh and worshiped. Then he went to his own house, and at his request they served him food, and he ate.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.12.21">His attendants asked him, "Why are you acting this way? While the child was alive, you fasted and wept, but now that the child is dead, you get up and eat!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.12.22">He answered, "While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept. I thought, 'Who knows? Yahweh may be gracious to me and let the child live.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.12.23">But now that he is dead, why should I go on fasting? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.12.24">Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and he went to her and made love to her. She gave birth to a son, and they named him Solomon. Yahweh loved him;</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Sam.12.25"><note type="study" n="2">Jedidiah means "loved by Yahweh."</note>and because Yahweh loved him, he sent word through Nathan the prophet to name him Jedidiah.</verse>
