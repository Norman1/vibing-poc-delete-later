      <chapter osisID="John.1" sID="John.1"/>
      <title type="main">The Word Became Flesh</title>
      <verse osisID="John.1.1">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.2">He was with God in the beginning.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.3">Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.4">In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.5">The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.6">There was a man sent from God whose name was John.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.7">He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all might believe.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.8">He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.9">The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.10">He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.11">He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.12">Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God—</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.13">children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.14">The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.15">(John testified concerning him. He cried out, saying, "This is the one I spoke about when I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'")</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.16">Out of his fullness we have all received grace in place of grace already given.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.17">For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.18">No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known.</verse>
      <title type="sub">John the Baptist Denies Being the Messiah</title>
      <verse osisID="John.1.19">Now this was John's testimony when the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.20">He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, "I am not the Messiah."</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.21">They asked him, "Then who are you? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." "Are you the Prophet?" He answered, "No."</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.22">Finally they said, "Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.23">John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, "I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way for the Lord.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.24">Now the Pharisees who had been sent</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.25">questioned him, "Why then do you baptize if you are not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.26">"I baptize with water," John replied, "but among you stands one you do not know.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.27">He is the one who comes after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie."</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.28">This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
      <title type="sub">John Testifies About Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="John.1.29">The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.30">This is the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.31">I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel."</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.32">Then John gave this testimony: "I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.33">And I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.34">I have seen and I testify that this is God's Chosen One."</verse>
      <title type="sub">John's Disciples Follow Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="John.1.35">The next day John was there again with two of his disciples.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.36">When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, "Look, the Lamb of God!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.37">When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.38">Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, "What do you want?" They said, "Rabbi" (which means "Teacher"), "where are you staying?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.39">"Come," he replied, "and you will see." So they went and saw where he was staying, and they spent that day with him. It was about four in the afternoon.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.40">Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.41">The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, "We have found the Messiah" (that is, the Christ).</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.42">And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas" (which, when translated, is Peter).</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Calls Philip and Nathanael</title>
      <verse osisID="John.1.43">The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, "Follow me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.44">Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.45">Philip found Nathanael and told him, "We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.46">"Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?" Nathanael asked. "Come and see," said Philip.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.47">When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, "Here truly is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit."</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.48">"How do you know me?" Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, "I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.49">Then Nathanael declared, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the king of Israel."</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.50">Jesus said, "You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You will see greater things than that."</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.1.51">He then added, "Very truly I tell you, you will see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."</verse>

      <chapter osisID="John.2" sID="John.2"/>
      <title type="main">Jesus Changes Water Into Wine</title>
      <verse osisID="John.2.1">On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother was there,</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.2.2">and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.2.3">When the wine was gone, Jesus' mother said to him, "They have no more wine."</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.2.4">"Woman, why do you involve me?" Jesus replied. "My hour has not yet come."</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.2.5">His mother said to the servants, "Do whatever he tells you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.2.6">Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.2.7">Jesus said to the servants, "Fill the jars with water"; so they filled them to the brim.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.2.8">Then he told them, "Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet." They did so,</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.2.9">and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.2.10">and said, "Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now."</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.2.11">What Jesus did here in Cana of Galilee was the first of the signs through which he revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.2.12">After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples. There they stayed for a few days.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Clears the Temple Courts</title>
      <verse osisID="John.2.13">When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.2.14">In the temple courts he found people selling cattle, sheep and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.2.15">So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple courts, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.2.16">To those who sold doves he said, "Get these out of here! Stop turning my Father's house into a market!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.2.17">His disciples remembered that it is written: "Zeal for your house will consume me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.2.18">The Jewish leaders then responded to him, "What sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.2.19">Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days."</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.2.20">They replied, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.2.21">But the temple he had spoken of was his body.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.2.22">After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he had said. Then they believed the scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.2.23">Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, many people saw the signs he was performing and believed in his name.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.2.24">But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew all people.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.2.25">He did not need any testimony about mankind, for he knew what was in each person.</verse>
      <chapter eID="John.2"/>
      <chapter osisID="John.3" sID="John.3"/>
      <title type="main">Jesus Teaches Nicodemus</title>
      <verse osisID="John.3.1">Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus who was a member of the Jewish ruling council.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.2">He came to Jesus at night and said, "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.3">Jesus replied, "Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again."</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.4">"How can someone be born when they are old?" Nicodemus asked. "Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother's womb to be born!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.5">Jesus answered, "Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.6">Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.7">You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You must be born again.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.8">The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit."</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.9">"How can this be?" Nicodemus asked.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.10">"You are Israel's teacher," said Jesus, "and do you not understand these things?</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.11">Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.12">I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things?</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.13">No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven—the Son of Man.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.14">Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.15">that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.16">For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.17">For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.18">Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God's one and only Son.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.19">This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.20">Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.21">But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.</verse>
      <title type="sub">John Testifies Again About Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="John.3.22">After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.23">Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were coming and being baptized.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.24">(This was before John was put in prison.)</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.25">An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.26">They came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan—the one you testified about—look, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.27">To this John replied, "A person can receive only what is given them from heaven.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.28">You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Messiah but am sent ahead of him.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.29">The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.30">He must become greater; I must become less."</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.31">The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.32">He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.33">Whoever has accepted it has certified that God is truthful.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.34">For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.35">The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands.</verse>
      <verse osisID="John.3.36">Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on them.</verse>
