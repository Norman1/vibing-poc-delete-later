        <verse osisID="Mic.1.1">The word of Yahweh that came to Micah of Moresheth during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judahâ€”the vision he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.1.2">Hear, all you peoples! Listen, earth and all who live in it, that the Sovereign Yahweh may bear witness against you, the Lord from his set apart temple<note type="translation">The Hebrew phrase refers to God's holy temple</note>.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.1.3">Look! Yahweh is coming from his dwelling place; he comes down and treads on the heights of the earth.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.1.4">The mountains melt beneath him and the valleys split apart, like wax before the fire, like water rushing down a slope.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.1.5">All this is because of Jacob's transgression, because of the sins of the people of Israel. What is Jacob's transgression? Is it not Samaria? What is Judah's high place? Is it not Jerusalem?</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.1.6">"Therefore I will make Samaria a heap of rubble, a place for planting vineyards. I will pour her stones into the valley and lay bare her foundations.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.1.7">All her idols will be broken to pieces; all her temple gifts will be burned with fire; I will destroy all her images. Since she gathered her gifts from the wages of prostitutes, as the wages of prostitutes they will again be used."</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">Weeping and Mourning</title>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.1.8">Because of this I will weep and wail; I will go about barefoot and naked. I will howl like a jackal and moan like an owl.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.1.9">For Samaria's plague is incurable; it has spread to Judah. It has reached the very gate of my people, even to Jerusalem itself.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.1.10">Tell it not in Gath; weep not at all. In Beth Ophrah roll in the dust.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.1.11">Pass by naked and in shame, you who live in Shaphir. Those who live in Zaanan will not come out. Beth Ezel is in mourning; it no longer protects you.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.1.12">Those who live in Maroth writhe in pain, waiting for relief, because disaster has come from Yahweh, even to the gate of Jerusalem.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.1.13">You who live in Lachish, harness fast horses to the chariot. You are where the sin of Daughter Zion began, for the transgressions of Israel were found in you.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.1.14">Therefore you will give parting gifts to Moresheth Gath. The town of Akzib will prove deceptive to the kings of Israel.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.1.15">I will bring a conqueror against you who live in Mareshah. The nobles of Israel will flee to Adullam.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mic.2.1">Terrible sorrow to those who plan twisted wrongness, to those who plot evil on their beds! At morning's light they carry it out because it is in their power to do it.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.2.2">They covet fields and seize them, and houses, and take them. They defraud people of their homes, they rob them of their inheritance.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.2.3">Therefore, this is what Yahweh says: "I am planning disaster against this people, from which you cannot save yourselves. You will no longer walk proudly, for it will be a time of calamity.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.2.4">In that day people will ridicule you; they will taunt you with this mournful song: 'We are utterly ruined; my people's possession is divided up. He takes it from me! He assigns our fields to traitors.'"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.2.5">Therefore you will have no one in the assembly of Yahweh to divide the land by lot.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mic.2.6">"Do not prophesy," their prophets say. "Do not prophesy about these things; disgrace will not overtake us."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.2.7">You descendants of Jacob, should it be said, "Does Yahweh become impatient? Does he do such things?" "Do not my words do good to the one whose ways are upright?</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.2.8">Lately my people have risen up like an enemy. You strip off the rich robe from those who pass by without a care, like men returning from battle.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mic.2.10">Get up, go away! For this is not your resting place, because it is defiled, it is ruined, beyond all remedy.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.2.11">If a liar and deceiver comes and says, 'I will prophesy for you plenty of wine and beer,' that would be just the prophet for this people!</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mic.3.3">who eat my people's flesh, strip off their skin and break their bones in pieces; who chop them up like meat for the pan, like flesh for the pot?"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.3.4">Then they will cry out to Yahweh, but he will not answer them. At that time he will hide his face from them because of the evil they have done.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.3.5">This is what Yahweh says: "As for the prophets who lead my people astray, they proclaim 'peace' if they have something to eat, but prepare to wage war against anyone who refuses to feed them.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.3.6">Therefore night will come over you, without visions, and darkness, without divination. The sun will set for the prophets, and the day will go dark for them.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.3.7">The seers will be ashamed and the diviners disgraced. They will all cover their faces because there is no answer from God."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.3.8">But as for me, I am filled with power, with the Spirit of Yahweh, and with justice and might, to declare to Jacob his transgression, to Israel his sin.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.3.9">Hear this, you leaders of Jacob, you rulers of Israel, who despise justice and distort all that is right;</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.3.10">who build Zion with bloodshed, and Jerusalem with wickedness.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.3.11">Her leaders judge for a bribe, her priests teach for a price, and her prophets tell fortunes for money. Yet they look for Yahweh's support and say, "Is not Yahweh among us? No disaster will come upon us."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.3.12">Therefore because of you, Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble, the temple hill a mound overgrown with thickets.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mic.4.2">Many nations will come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh, to the temple of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths." The law will go out from Zion, the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.4.3">He will judge between many peoples and will settle disputes for strong nations far and wide. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.4.4">Everyone will sit under their own vine and under their own fig tree, and no one will make them afraid, for Yahweh of armies has spoken.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Mic.4.10">Writhe in agony, Daughter Zion, like a woman in labor, for now you must leave the city to camp in the open field. You will go to Babylon; there you will be rescued. There Yahweh will buy you back out of the hand of your enemies.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.4.11">But now many nations are gathered against you. They say, "Let her be defiled, let our eyes gloat over Zion!"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Mic.4.12">But they do not know the thoughts of Yahweh; they do not understand his plan, that he has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor.</verse>
