      <title type="main">The Transfiguration</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.1">And he said to them, "Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see that the kingdom of God has come with power."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.2">After six days Jesus took Peter, James and John with him and led them up a high mountain, where they were all alone. There he was transfigured before them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.3">His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.4">And there appeared before them Elijah and Moses, who were talking with Jesus.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.5">Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.6">(He did not know what to say, they were so frightened.)</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.7">Then a cloud appeared and covered them, and a voice came from the cloud: "This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.8">Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.9">As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.10">They kept the matter to themselves, discussing what "rising from the dead" meant.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.11">And they asked him, "Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.12">Jesus replied, "To be sure, Elijah does come first, and restores all things. Why then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and be rejected?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.13">But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they have done to him everything they wished, just as it is written about him."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Heals a Boy Possessed by an Impure Spirit</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.14">When they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.15">As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with wonder and ran to greet him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.16">"What are you arguing with them about?" he asked.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.17">A man in the crowd answered, "Teacher, I brought you my son, who is possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of speech.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.18">Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit, but they could not."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.19">"You unbelieving generation," Jesus replied, "how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.20">So they brought him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.21">Jesus asked the boy's father, "How long has he been like this?" "From childhood," he answered.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.22">"It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him. But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.23">"'If you can'?" said Jesus. "Everything is possible for one who believes."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.24">Immediately the boy's father exclaimed, "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.25">When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the impure spirit. "You deaf and mute spirit," he said, "I command you, come out of him and never enter him again."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.26">The spirit shrieked, convulsed him violently and came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, "He's dead."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.27">But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.28">After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.29">He replied, "This kind can come out only by prayer."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Predicts His Death a Second Time</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.30">They left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.31">because he was teaching his disciples. He said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.32">But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Who Is the Greatest?</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.33">They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, "What were you arguing about on the road?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.34">But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.35">Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, "Anyone who wants to be first must be the very last, and the servant of all."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.36">He took a little child whom he placed among them. Taking the child in his arms, he said to them,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.37">"Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Whoever Is Not Against Us Is for Us</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.38">"Teacher," said John, "we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop, because he was not one of us."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.39">"Do not stop him," Jesus said. "For no one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.40">for whoever is not against us is for us.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.41">Truly I tell you, anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to the Messiah will certainly not lose their reward.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Causing to Stumble</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.42">"If anyone causes one of these little ones—those who believe in me—to stumble, it would be better for them if a large millstone were hung around their neck and they were thrown into the sea.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.43">If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.45">And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.47">And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.48">where 'the worms that eat them do not die, and the fire is not quenched.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.49">Everyone will be salted with fire.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.9.50">"Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can you make it salty again? Have salt among yourselves, and be at peace with each other."</verse>

      <title type="main">Divorce</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.1">Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Again crowds of people came to him, and as was his custom, he taught them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.2">Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.3">"What did Moses command you?" he replied.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.4">They said, "Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.5">"It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law," Jesus replied.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.6">"But at the beginning of creation God 'made them male and female.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.7">'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.8">and the two will become one flesh.' So they are no longer two, but one flesh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.9">Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.10">When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.11">He answered, "Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.12">And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Little Children and Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.13">People were bringing little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them, but the disciples rebuked them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.14">When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.15">Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.16">And he took the children in his arms, placed his hands on them and blessed them.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Rich and the Kingdom of God</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.17">As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. "Good teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.18">"Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No one is good—except God alone.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.19">You know the commandments: 'You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, you shall not defraud, honor your father and mother.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.20">"Teacher," he declared, "all these I have kept since I was a boy."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.21">Jesus looked at him and loved him. "One thing you lack," he said. "Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.22">At this the man's face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.23">Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.24">The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, "Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.25">It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.26">The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, "Who then can be saved?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.27">Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.28">Then Peter spoke up, "We have left everything to follow you!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.29">"Truly I tell you," Jesus replied, "no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.30">will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age: homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields—along with persecutions—and in the age to come eternal life.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.31">But many who are first will be last, and the last first."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Predicts His Death a Third Time</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.32">They were on their way up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid. Again he took the Twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.33">"We are going up to Jerusalem," he said, "and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.34">who will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Request of James and John</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.35">Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. "Teacher," they said, "we want you to do for us whatever we ask."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.36">"What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.37">They replied, "Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.38">"You don't know what you are asking," Jesus said. "Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.39">"We can," they answered. Jesus said to them, "You will drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.40">but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.41">When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.42">Jesus called them together and said, "You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.43">Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.44">and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.45">For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Blind Bartimaeus Receives His Sight</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.46">Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (which means "son of Timaeus"), was sitting by the roadside begging.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.47">When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.48">Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.49">Jesus stopped and said, "Call him." So they called to the blind man, "Cheer up! On your feet! He's calling you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.50">Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.51">"What do you want me to do for you?" Jesus asked him. The blind man said, "Rabbi, I want to see."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.10.52">"Go," said Jesus, "your faith has healed you." Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.</verse>
