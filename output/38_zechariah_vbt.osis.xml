        <verse osisID="Zech.1.6">But did not my words and my decrees, which I commanded my servants the prophets, overtake your ancestors?

        <title type="chapter">Chapter 9</title>
        <title type="main">Judgment on Surrounding Nations</title>
        <verse osisID="Zech.9.1">A declaration: The word of Yahweh is against the land of Hadrach and will rest upon Damascus, for the eyes of all mankind and all the tribes of Israel are toward Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.9.2">This declaration also concerns Hamath, which borders on Damascus, and Tyre and Sidon, even though they are very wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.9.3">Tyre has built herself a stronghold and heaped up silver like dust and refined gold like mud in the streets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.9.4">Look! The Lord will dispossess her and destroy her strength on the sea, so she will be consumed by fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.9.5">Ashkelon will see and be afraid! Gaza also will be in great anguish! Ekron too, for her hope will be disappointed! The king will perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon will no longer be inhabited!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.9.6">Foreigners will live in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.9.7">For I will remove the blood from his mouth and the detestable things from between his teeth. Then he also will become a remnant for our God and will become like a clan in Judah, and Ekron will become like the Jebusites.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.9.8">I will encamp around my house against armies, so no one will pass through or return, for no oppressor will pass through them again, since I myself have seen it now.</verse>
        
        <title type="main">The Coming King</title>
        <verse osisID="Zech.9.9">Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion! Shout with joy, daughter of Jerusalem! Look! Your king is coming to you! He does what's right and is able to save. He is humble and is riding on a donkey, on the colt of a female donkey.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.9.10">I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem, and the bow of war will be cut off. He will speak peace to the nations, and his dominion will be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.9.11">As for you, because of the blood of your covenant, I will set your prisoners free from the pit where there is no water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.9.12">Return to the stronghold, you prisoners of hope! Even today I am declaring that I will return double to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.9.13">For I have bent Judah as my bow and have filled it with Ephraim. I have stirred up your sons, Zion, against your sons, Greece, and have made you like a warrior's sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.9.14">Yahweh will appear over them and his arrows will go out like lightning! The Lord Yahweh will blow the trumpet and will go out in the whirlwinds of the south.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.9.15">Yahweh of armies will defend them, and they will devour and will tread on the sling stones. They will drink and be noisy like those full of wine, and they will be full like bowls, like the corners of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.9.16">So Yahweh their God will rescue them on that day, as the flock of his people, for they are the stones of a crown that sparkle over his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.9.17">How good and how beautiful they will be! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgin daughters.</verse>

        <title type="main">Yahweh Will Care for Judah</title>
        <verse osisID="Zech.10.1">Ask for rain from Yahweh in the season of the spring rain—from Yahweh who makes thunderclouds, and he gives rain showers to everyone and plants in the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.10.2">For household idols speak falsely, and the diviners envision a lie; they tell empty dreams and give empty comfort. Therefore the people wander like sheep and are afflicted because there is no shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.10.3">My anger burns against the shepherds; it is the male goats—the leaders—that I will punish. Yahweh of armies will care for his flock, the house of Judah, and will make them like his majestic horse in battle!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.10.4">From him will come the cornerstone; from him will come the tent peg; from him will come the battle bow; from him will come every ruler together.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.10.5">They will be like mighty warriors, trampling their enemies in the mud of the streets in battle, since Yahweh is with them; and they will shame those who ride on horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.10.6">"I will strengthen the house of Judah and save the house of Joseph; and I will restore them, for I have compassion on them. They will be as though I had not rejected them, for I am Yahweh their God, and I will answer them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.10.7">Then Ephraim will become like a mighty warrior, and their hearts will rejoice as with wine; and their children will see and rejoice. Their hearts will be glad in Yahweh!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.10.8">I will whistle for them and gather them, for I will buy them back, and they will become as numerous as they previously were.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.10.9">I sowed them among the peoples, but in distant countries they will remember me and will live with their children, and they will return.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.10.10">For I will restore them from the land of Egypt and gather them from Assyria. I will bring them to the land of Gilead and Lebanon until there is no more room for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.10.11">They will pass through the sea of affliction; he will strike the waves in that sea and will dry up all the depths of the Nile. The majesty of Assyria will be brought down, and the scepter of Egypt will be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.10.12">I will strengthen them in Yahweh, and they will walk in his name"—this is Yahweh's declaration.</verse>

        <title type="main">The Destruction of the Wicked Shepherds</title>
        <verse osisID="Zech.11.1">Open your doors, Lebanon, that fire may devour your cedars!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.11.2">Wail, cypress trees, for the cedar trees have fallen! What was majestic has been devastated! Wail, you oaks of Bashan, for the impenetrable forest has gone down!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.11.3">Listen to the wailing of the shepherds, for their majesty has been destroyed! Listen to the roaring of the young lions, for the thickets of the Jordan have been devastated!</verse>
        
        <title type="main">Yahweh's Flock Doomed for Slaughter</title>
        <verse osisID="Zech.11.4">This is what Yahweh my God says: "Shepherd the flock doomed for slaughter!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.11.5">The ones who buy them slaughter them and are not punished, and the ones who sell them say, 'Blessed be Yahweh! I have become rich!' For their shepherds have no pity on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.11.6">For I will no longer pity the inhabitants of the land"—this is Yahweh's declaration. "Look! I am putting every person into the hand of his neighbor and into the hand of his king, and they will crush the land, and I will not rescue anyone from their hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.11.7">So I shepherded the flock doomed for slaughter, the most afflicted of the flock. I took two staffs; one staff I called "Favor" and the other I called "Unity." So I shepherded the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.11.8">I destroyed the three shepherds in one month, for I ran out of patience with them, and they also hated me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.11.9">Then I said, "I will not shepherd you! The one who is dying—let him die. The one who is being destroyed—let him be destroyed. Let the ones who remain devour the flesh of one another."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.11.10">So I took my staff "Favor" and broke it to break my covenant that I had made with all the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.11.11">So it was broken in that day, and the afflicted of the flock who were watching me knew that it was a word from Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.11.12">I said to them, "If it seems good to you, give me my wages; but if not, never mind." So they weighed out my wages, thirty pieces of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.11.13">Yahweh said to me, "Throw it to the potter," this magnificent price at which they valued me! So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of Yahweh, to the potter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.11.14">Then I broke my second staff "Unity" to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.11.15">Yahweh said to me, "Again, take the equipment of a foolish shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.11.16">For look, I am about to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for the perishing sheep. He will not seek the scattered, he will not heal the broken, and he will not nourish the healthy ones. Instead, he will eat the flesh of the fattened sheep and will tear off their hooves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.11.17">Woe to the worthless shepherd who abandons the flock! May the sword come against his arm and his right eye! May his arm be completely withered and his right eye be completely blind!"</verse>

        <verse osisID="Zech.12.1">A declaration of the word of Yahweh concerning Israel—a declaration of Yahweh, who stretches out the heavens and lays the foundation of the earth, and who forms the spirit of mankind within him:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.12.2">"Look, I am about to make Jerusalem into a cup of reeling for all the surrounding peoples, and it will also be against Judah in the siege against Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.12.3">It will happen in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples. All who lift it will be severely injured, though all the nations of the earth will gather against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.12.4">In that day"—this is Yahweh's declaration—"I will strike every horse with confusion and its rider with madness. Over the house of Judah I will open my eyes, but every horse of the armies I will strike with blindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.12.5">Then the leaders of Judah will say in their hearts, 'The inhabitants of Jerusalem are our strength because of Yahweh of armies, their God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.12.6">In that day I will make the leaders of Judah like firepots among wood and like flaming torches among grain stalks, and they will consume all the surrounding peoples on the right and on the left. Jerusalem will again live in her own place, in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.12.7">Yahweh will save the tents of Judah first, so that the honor of the house of David and the honor of those who live in Jerusalem may not be greater than that of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.12.8">In that day Yahweh will be like a shield around the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on that day the one who is weak among them will be like David, while the house of David will be like God, like the angel of Yahweh before them!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.12.9">It will come about in that day that I will begin to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.</verse>
        
        <title type="main">Mourning for the One They Pierced</title>
        <verse osisID="Zech.12.10">But I will pour out a spirit of favor and pleadings on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so they will look on me, the one whom they have pierced. They will mourn for me, as one mourns for an only son; they will bitterly lament for me, as one laments bitterly for a firstborn son.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.12.11">In that day the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning for Hadad Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.12.12">The land will mourn, each clan by itself: the clan of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the clan of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.12.13">the clan of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the clan of the Shimeites by itself, and their wives by themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.12.14">and all the remaining clans, each clan by itself and their wives by themselves.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Zech.13.1">In that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem to cleanse them from sin and from impurity.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.13.2">"It will come about in that day"—this is the declaration of Yahweh of armies—"that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land and they will no longer be remembered. I will also cause the prophets and the spirit of uncleanness to leave the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.13.3">If any man continues to prophesy, his father and his mother who bore him will tell him, 'You will not live, for you speak lies in the name of Yahweh!' Then his father and mother who bore him will pierce him when he prophesies.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.13.4">It will happen in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies, and they will no longer wear a hairy cloak in order to deceive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.13.5">For each will say, 'I am not a prophet! I am a man who works the soil, for a man sold me in my youth!'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.13.6">But someone will say to him, 'What are these wounds between your arms?' and he will answer, 'I was wounded in my friends' house.'"</verse>

        <verse osisID="Zech.13.8">It will come to pass in all the land"—this is Yahweh's declaration—"that two-thirds of it will be cut off and perish, but one-third will remain alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.13.9">I will bring that third into the fire and will refine them as silver is refined; I will test them as gold is tested. They will call on my name, and I will answer them and say, 'This is my people!' and they will say, 'Yahweh is my God!'"</verse>

        <title type="main">The Final Victory</title>
        <verse osisID="Zech.14.1">Look! A day for Yahweh is coming when your plunder will be divided in your midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.14.2">For I will gather every nation against Jerusalem for battle, and the city will be captured. The houses will be plundered and the women raped. Half of the city will go out into captivity, but the remainder of the people will not be cut off from the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.14.3">But Yahweh will go out and fight against those nations as when he fights on the day of battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.14.4">On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is beside Jerusalem on the east, and the Mount of Olives will be split in half between east and west by a very great valley, and half of the mountain will remove toward the north and half toward the south.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.14.5">Then you will flee down the valley between my mountains, for the valley between the mountains will extend to Azal. You will flee just as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah. Then Yahweh my God will come, and all the set apart ones will be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.14.6">It will happen in that day that there will be no light, but no cold or frost either.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.14.7">It will be a day known only to Yahweh—neither day nor night—but in the evening there will be light.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.14.8">It will also come about in that day that living waters will go out from Jerusalem; half of them will go to the eastern sea and half to the western sea, in summer and in winter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.14.9">Yahweh will be king over all the earth. In that day Yahweh will be one, and his name will be one.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.14.10">All the land will be like the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. But Jerusalem will be raised up and remain in its place, from the Benjamin Gate to the place of the first gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king's winepresses.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.14.11">People will live in Jerusalem, and there will be no more complete destruction from God on it. Jerusalem will live in safety.</verse>
        
        <title type="main">Punishment on Jerusalem's Enemies</title>
        <verse osisID="Zech.14.12">This will be the plague with which Yahweh will attack all the peoples who have fought against Jerusalem: their flesh will rot away while they are still standing on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.14.13">It will happen in that day that a great panic from Yahweh will be among them. Each man will seize the hand of another, and the hand of one will be raised against the hand of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.14.14">Judah will also fight at Jerusalem, and they will gather the wealth of all the surrounding nations—gold, silver, and clothing in great abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.14.15">A plague like this will also attack the horses, the mules, the camels, the donkeys, and all the animals that are in those camps.</verse>
        
        <title type="main">All Nations Will Worship Yahweh</title>
        <verse osisID="Zech.14.16">Then it will happen that all who remain from all the nations that came against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, Yahweh of armies, and to celebrate the Festival of Shelters.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.14.17">It will be that if anyone from all the nations of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, Yahweh of armies, then Yahweh will not bring rain on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.14.18">If the nation of Egypt does not go up, then they will not receive rain either. This will be the plague with which Yahweh will attack the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Festival of Shelters.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.14.19">This will be the punishment for the sin of Egypt and the punishment for the sin of all the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Festival of Shelters.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.14.20">In that day the bells of the horses will be inscribed "Set Apart to Yahweh," and the cooking pots in Yahweh's house will be like the bowls before the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Zech.14.21">Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be set apart to Yahweh of armies, and all who come to sacrifice will take them and cook in them. There will no longer be a Canaanite <note>Or merchant</note> in the house of Yahweh of armies in that day.</verse>
