        <title type="chapter">Paul's Appeal for Onesimus</title>
        
        <title type="sub">Greeting</title>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.1">Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker—</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.2">also to Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier—and to the church that meets in your home:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.3">Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">Thanksgiving and Prayer</title>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.4">I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.5">because I hear about your love for all his people set apart for God<note type="translation">Greek: saints</note> and your faith in the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.6">I pray that your partnership with us in the faith may be effective in deepening your understanding of every good thing we share for the sake of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.7">Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the Lord's people.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">Paul's Plea for Onesimus</title>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.8">Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.9">yet I prefer to appeal to you on the basis of love. It is as none other than Paul—an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus—</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.10">that I appeal to you for my son Onesimus,<note type="translation">Onesimus means "useful"</note> who became my son while I was in chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.11">Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.12">I am sending him—who is my very heart—back to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.13">I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.14">But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do would not seem forced but would be voluntary.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.15">Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back forever—</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.16">no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a fellow man and as a brother in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.17">So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.18">If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.19">I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back—not to mention that you owe me your very self.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.20">I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.21">Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.22">And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">Final Greetings</title>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.23">Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.24">And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Phlm.1.25">The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</verse>
