        <verse osisID="2Kgs.1.2"><name type="person">Ahaziah</name> fell through the latticed window in his upper room in <name type="geographic">Samaria</name> and was injured. He sent messengers and said to them, "Go ask <name type="person">Baal-Zebub</name>, the god of <name type="geographic">Ekron</name>, whether I will recover from this injury."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.1.3">But the angel of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> said to <name type="person">Elijah the Tishbite</name>, "Get up, go to meet the messengers of the king of <name type="geographic">Samaria</name>, and ask them, 'Is it because there is no God in <name type="geographic">Israel</name> that you are going to seek <name type="person">Baal-Zebub</name>, the god of <name type="geographic">Ekron</name>?'</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.1.4">Now therefore this is what <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> says: 'You will not come down from the bed on which you have gone up, but you will surely die.'" And <name type="person">Elijah</name> went.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.1.5">When the messengers returned to <name type="person">Ahaziah</name>, he asked them, "Why have you come back?"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.1.6">They told him, "A man came up to meet us and said to us, 'Go back to the king who sent you and tell him, "This is what <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> says: Is it because there is no God in <name type="geographic">Israel</name> that you are sending messengers to seek <name type="person">Baal-Zebub</name>, the god of <name type="geographic">Ekron</name>? Therefore you will not come down from the bed on which you have gone up, but you will surely die."'"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.1.7"><name type="person">Ahaziah</name> asked them, "What did this man look like who came up to meet you and told you these things?"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.1.8">They replied, "He was a hairy man with a leather belt around his waist." The king said, "It was <name type="person">Elijah the Tishbite</name>."</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">Fire from Heaven</title>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.1.9">Then the king sent to <name type="person">Elijah</name> a captain of fifty with his fifty men. The captain went up to <name type="person">Elijah</name>, who was sitting on the top of a hill, and said to him, "Man of God, the king has said, 'Come down.'"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.1.10"><name type="person">Elijah</name> answered the captain of fifty, "If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men." Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.1.11">Again <name type="person">Ahaziah</name> sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. He went up and said to <name type="person">Elijah</name>, "Man of God, this is what the king has said: 'Come down quickly.'"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.1.12"><name type="person">Elijah</name> answered them, "If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men." Then the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.1.13">Again the king sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. The third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before <name type="person">Elijah</name>, and begged him, and said to him, "Man of God, please let my life and the life of these fifty of your servants, be precious in your sight.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.1.14">Pay attention! Fire came down from heaven, and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties. But now let my life be precious in your sight."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.1.15">The angel of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> said to <name type="person">Elijah</name>, "Go down with him. Don't be afraid of him." He arose, and went down with him to the king.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.1.16">He said to him, "This is what <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> says: 'Because you have sent messengers to seek <name type="person">Baal-Zebub</name>, the god of <name type="geographic">Ekron</name>, is it because there is no God in <name type="geographic">Israel</name> to ask his word? Therefore you will not come down from the bed on which you have gone up, but will surely die.'"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.1.17">So <name type="person">Ahaziah</name> died according to the word of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> which <name type="person">Elijah</name> had spoken. <name type="person">Jehoram</name> began to reign in his place in the second year of <name type="person">Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat</name>, king of <name type="geographic">Judah</name>; because he had no son.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.1.18">Now the rest of the acts of <name type="person">Ahaziah</name> which he did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of <name type="geographic">Israel</name>?</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Kgs.2.2"><name type="person">Elijah</name> said to <name type="person">Elisha</name>, "Please stay here, for <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> has sent me to <name type="geographic">Bethel</name>." <name type="person">Elisha</name> said, "As <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you." So they went down to <name type="geographic">Bethel</name>.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.2.3">The group of prophets who were at <name type="geographic">Bethel</name> came out to <name type="person">Elisha</name>, and said to him, "Do you know that <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> will take away your master from over you today?" He said, "Yes, I know it. Keep quiet."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.2.4"><name type="person">Elijah</name> said to him, "<name type="person">Elisha</name>, please stay here, for <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> has sent me to <name type="geographic">Jericho</name>." He said, "As <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you." So they came to <name type="geographic">Jericho</name>.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.2.5">The group of prophets who were at <name type="geographic">Jericho</name> came to <name type="person">Elisha</name>, and said to him, "Do you know that <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> will take away your master from over you today?"

        <verse osisID="2Kgs.2.6"><name type="person">Elijah</name> said to him, "Please stay here, for <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> has sent me to the <name type="geographic">Jordan</name>." He said, "As <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you." They both went on.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.2.7">Fifty men of the group of the prophets went and stood opposite them at a distance; and they both stood by the <name type="geographic">Jordan</name>.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.2.8"><name type="person">Elijah</name> took his cloak, and wrapped it together, and struck the waters; and they were divided here and there, so that they both went over on dry ground.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.2.9">When they had gone over, <name type="person">Elijah</name> said to <name type="person">Elisha</name>, "Ask for whatever I should do for you, before I am taken from you." <name type="person">Elisha</name> said, "Please let a double portion of your spirit be on me."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.2.10">He said, "You have asked a hard thing. If you see me when I am taken from you, it will be so for you; but if not, it will not be so."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.2.11">As they continued on and talked, pay attention, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated them; and <name type="person">Elijah</name> went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.2.12"><name type="person">Elisha</name> saw it, and he cried, "My father, my father, the chariots of <name type="geographic">Israel</name> and its horsemen!" He saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them in two pieces.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">Elisha's Ministry Begins</title>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.2.13">He also took up the cloak of <name type="person">Elijah</name> that fell from him, and went back and stood by the bank of the <name type="geographic">Jordan</name>.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.2.14">He took <name type="person">Elijah's</name> cloak that fell from him, and struck the waters, and said, "Where is <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, the God of <name type="person">Elijah</name>?" When he also had struck the waters, they were divided here and there; and <name type="person">Elisha</name> went over.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.2.15">When the group of prophets who were at <name type="geographic">Jericho</name> saw him at a distance, they said, "The spirit of <name type="person">Elijah</name> rests on <name type="person">Elisha</name>." They came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.2.16">They said to him, "See now, there are with your servants fifty strong men. Please let them go and seek your master. Perhaps the Spirit of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> has taken him up, and put him on some mountain, or into some valley." He said, "Don't send them."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.2.17">When they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, "Send them." Therefore they sent fifty men; and they searched for three days, but didn't find him.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.2.18">They came back to him while he stayed at <name type="geographic">Jericho</name>; and he said to them, "Didn't I tell you not to go?"</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">Elisha's First Miracles</title>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.2.19">The men of the city said to <name type="person">Elisha</name>, "Pay attention, please. The location of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land causes women to miscarry."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.2.20">He said, "Bring me a new bowl, and put salt in it." So they brought it to him.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.2.21">He went out to the spring of the waters, and threw salt into it, and said, "This is what <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> says: 'I have healed these waters. There will not be from there any more death or barren land.'"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.2.22">So the waters were healed to this day, according to <name type="person">Elisha's</name> word which he spoke.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.2.23">He went up from there to <name type="geographic">Bethel</name>. As he was going up on the way, some young boys came out of the city and mocked him, and said to him, "Go up, you bald head! Go up, you bald head!"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.2.24">He looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>. Then two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of those boys.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.2.25">He went from there to <name type="geographic">Mount Carmel</name>, and from there he returned to <name type="geographic">Samaria</name>.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Kgs.3.2">He did that which was evil in the sight of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, but not like his father and like his mother; for he put away the pillar of <name type="person">Baal</name> that his father had made.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.3.3">Nevertheless he held to the sins of <name type="person">Jeroboam the son of Nebat</name>, with which he made <name type="geographic">Israel</name> to sin. He didn't depart from it.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.3.4">Now <name type="person">Mesha</name> king of <name type="geographic">Moab</name> was a sheep breeder; and he supplied the king of <name type="geographic">Israel</name> with one hundred thousand lambs, and the wool of one hundred thousand rams.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.3.5">But when <name type="person">Ahab</name> died, the king of <name type="geographic">Moab</name> rebelled against the king of <name type="geographic">Israel</name>.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.3.6">King <name type="person">Jehoram</name> went out of <name type="geographic">Samaria</name> at that time, and mustered all <name type="geographic">Israel</name>.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.3.7">He went and sent to <name type="person">Jehoshaphat</name> the king of <name type="geographic">Judah</name>, saying, "The king of <name type="geographic">Moab</name> has rebelled against me.

        <verse osisID="2Kgs.3.8">Then he said, "Which way shall we go up?" <name type="person">Jehoram</name> answered, "The way of the wilderness of <name type="geographic">Edom</name>."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.3.9">So the king of <name type="geographic">Israel</name> went with the king of <name type="geographic">Judah</name> and the king of <name type="geographic">Edom</name>, and they marched for seven days along a circuitous route. There was no water for the army or for the animals that followed them.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.3.10">The king of <name type="geographic">Israel</name> said, "Alas! For <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of <name type="geographic">Moab</name>."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.3.11">But <name type="person">Jehoshaphat</name> said, "Isn't there here a prophet of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, that we may seek <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> by him?" One of the king of <name type="geographic">Israel's</name> servants answered, "<name type="person">Elisha the son of Shaphat</name> is here, who poured water on the hands of <name type="person">Elijah</name>."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.3.12"><name type="person">Jehoshaphat</name> said, "The word of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> is with him."

        <verse osisID="2Kgs.3.13"><name type="person">Elisha</name> said to the king of <name type="geographic">Israel</name>, "What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother." The king of <name type="geographic">Israel</name> said to him, "No; for <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of <name type="geographic">Moab</name>."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.3.14"><name type="person">Elisha</name> said, "As <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> of Armies lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I respect the presence of <name type="person">Jehoshaphat</name> the king of <name type="geographic">Judah</name>, I would not look toward you, nor see you.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.3.15">But now bring me a musician." When the musician played, the hand of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> came on him.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.3.16">He said, "This is what <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> says: 'Make this valley full of trenches.'</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.3.17">For this is what <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> says: 'You will not see wind, neither will you see rain; yet that valley will be filled with water, and you will drink, both you and your livestock and your animals.'</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.3.18">This is an easy thing in the sight of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>. He will also deliver the <name type="people">Moabites</name> into your hand.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.3.19">You shall strike every fortified city and every choice city, and shall cut down every good tree, and stop all springs of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.3.20">In the morning, about the time of offering the sacrifice, pay attention, water came by the way of <name type="geographic">Edom</name>, and the country was filled with water.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.3.21">Now when all the <name type="people">Moabites</name> heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all who were able to put on armor, young and old, and stood on the border.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.3.22">They rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the <name type="people">Moabites</name> saw the water opposite them as red as blood.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.3.23">They said, "This is blood. The kings have surely destroyed themselves, and struck one another. Now therefore, <name type="geographic">Moab</name>, to the plunder!"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.3.24">When they came to the camp of <name type="geographic">Israel</name>, the <name type="people">Israelites</name> rose up and struck the <name type="people">Moabites</name>, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land attacking the <name type="people">Moabites</name>.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.3.25">They beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land each man cast his stone, and filled it. They stopped all the springs of water, and cut down all the good trees, until in <name type="geographic">Kir Hareseth</name> all they left was its stones; however the men armed with slings went around it, and attacked it.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.3.26">When the king of <name type="geographic">Moab</name> saw that the battle was too severe for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew sword, to break through to the king of <name type="geographic">Edom</name>; but they could not.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.3.27">Then he took his oldest son who would have reigned in his place, and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. There was great wrath against <name type="geographic">Israel</name>; and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.</verse>

        <verse osisID="2Kgs.5.4">Someone went in, and told his lord, saying, "The girl who is from the land of <name type="geographic">Israel</name> said this."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.5.5">The king of <name type="geographic">Syria</name> said, "Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of <name type="geographic">Israel</name>." He departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of clothing.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.5.6">He brought the letter to the king of <name type="geographic">Israel</name>, saying, "Now when this letter has come to you, pay attention, I have sent <name type="person">Naaman</name> my servant to you, that you may heal him of his leprosy."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.5.7">When the king of <name type="geographic">Israel</name> had read the letter, he tore his clothes, and said, "Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends to me to heal a man of his leprosy? But please consider and see how he seeks a quarrel against me."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.5.8">It was so, when <name type="person">Elisha</name> the man of God heard that the king of <name type="geographic">Israel</name> had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, "Why have you torn your clothes?

        <verse osisID="2Kgs.5.9">So <name type="person">Naaman</name> came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of <name type="person">Elisha</name>.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.5.10"><name type="person">Elisha</name> sent a messenger to him, saying, "Go and wash in the <name type="geographic">Jordan</name> seven times, and your flesh shall come back to you, and you shall be clean."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.5.11">But <name type="person">Naaman</name> was angry, and went away, and said, "Pay attention, I thought, 'He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> his God, and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leper.'</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.5.12">Aren't <name type="geographic">Abana</name> and <name type="geographic">Pharpar</name>, the rivers of <name type="geographic">Damascus</name>, better than all the waters of <name type="geographic">Israel</name>? Couldn't I wash in them, and be clean?" So he turned and went away in a rage.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.5.13">His servants came near, and spoke to him, and said, "My father, if the prophet had asked you to do some great thing, wouldn't you have done it? How much more then, when he says to you, 'Wash, and be clean?'"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.5.14">Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the <name type="geographic">Jordan</name>, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.5.15">He returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, "Pay attention, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in <name type="geographic">Israel</name>. Now therefore, please take a gift from your servant."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.5.16">But he said, "As <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none." He urged him to take it; but he refused.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.5.17"><name type="person">Naaman</name> said, "If not, then please let two mules' burden of earth be given to your servant; for your servant will from now on offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.5.18">In this thing may <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of <name type="person">Rimmon</name> to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of <name type="person">Rimmon</name>, when I bow myself in the house of <name type="person">Rimmon</name>, may <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> pardon your servant in this thing."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.5.19">He said to him, "Go in peace." So he departed from him a little way.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">Gehazi's Greed and Punishment</title>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.5.20">But <name type="person">Gehazi</name> the servant of <name type="person">Elisha</name> the man of God, said, "Pay attention, my master has spared this <name type="person">Naaman</name> the <name type="people">Syrian</name>, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought. As <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> lives, I will run after him, and take something from him."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.5.21">So <name type="person">Gehazi</name> followed after <name type="person">Naaman</name>. When <name type="person">Naaman</name> saw one running after him, he came down from the chariot to meet him, and said, "Is all well?"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.5.22">He said, "All is well. My master has sent me, saying, 'Pay attention, even now two young men of the group of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of <name type="geographic">Ephraim</name>. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothing.'"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.5.23"><name type="person">Naaman</name> said, "Be pleased to take two talents." He urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and laid them on two of his servants; and they carried them before him.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.5.24">When he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and stored them in the house. Then he let the men go, and they departed.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.5.25">But he went in, and stood before his master. <name type="person">Elisha</name> said to him, "Where did you come from, <name type="person">Gehazi</name>?" He said, "Your servant went nowhere."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.5.26">He said to him, "Didn't my heart go with you, when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive groves and vineyards, and sheep and cattle, and male servants and female servants?</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="2Kgs.5.27">Therefore the leprosy of <name type="person">Naaman</name> will cling to you and to your offspring forever." He went out from his presence a leper, as white as snow.</verse>
