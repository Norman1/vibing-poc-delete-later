      <title type="sub">Hannah's Prayer for a Son</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.1">There was a certain man from Ramathaim, a Zuphite from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.2">He had two wives; one was called Hannah and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.3">Year after year this man went up from his town to worship and sacrifice to Yahweh Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests of Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.4">Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.5">But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her, and Yahweh had closed her womb.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.6">Because Yahweh had closed Hannah's womb, her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.7">This went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of Yahweh, her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.8">Her husband Elkanah would say to her, "Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don't you eat? Why are you downhearted? Don't I mean more to you than ten sons?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.9">Once when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his chair by the doorpost of Yahweh's temple.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.10">In her deep anguish Hannah prayed to Yahweh, weeping bitterly.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.11">And she made a vow, saying, "Yahweh Almighty, if you will only look on your servant's misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to Yahweh for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used on his head."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.12">As she kept on praying to Yahweh, Eli observed her mouth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.13">Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard. Eli thought she was drunk</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.14">and said to her, "How long are you going to stay drunk? Put away your wine."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.15">"Not so, my lord," Hannah replied, "I am a woman who is deeply troubled. I have not been drinking wine or beer; I was pouring out my soul to Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.16">Do not take your servant for a wicked woman; I have been praying here out of my great anguish and grief."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.17">Eli answered, "Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked of him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.18">She said, "May your servant find favor in your eyes." Then she went her way and ate something, and her face was no longer downcast.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.19">Early the next morning they arose and worshiped before Yahweh and then went back to their home at Ramah. Elkanah made love to his wife Hannah, and Yahweh remembered her.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.20"><note type="study" n="1">The name Samuel sounds like the Hebrew for "heard by God."</note>So in the course of time Hannah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, saying, "Because I asked Yahweh for him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.21">When her husband Elkanah went up with all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to Yahweh and to fulfill his vow,</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.22">Hannah did not go. She said to her husband, "After the boy is weaned, I will take him and present him before Yahweh, and he will live there always."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.23">"Do what seems best to you," her husband Elkanah told her. "Stay here until you have weaned him; only may Yahweh make good his word." So the woman stayed at home and nursed her son until she had weaned him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.24">After he was weaned, she took the boy with her, young as he was, along with a three-year-old bull, about twenty-two pounds of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of Yahweh at Shiloh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.25">When the bull had been sacrificed, they brought the boy to Eli,</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.26">and she said to him, "Pardon me, my lord. As surely as you live, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.27">I prayed for this child, and Yahweh has granted me what I asked of him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.28">So now I give him to Yahweh. For his whole life he will be given over to Yahweh." And he worshiped Yahweh there.</verse>
      <chapter eID="1Sam.1"/>

      <chapter osisID="1Sam.2" sID="1Sam.2"/>
      <title type="sub">Hannah's Prayer of Praise</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.1">Then Hannah prayed and said: "My heart rejoices in Yahweh; in Yahweh my horn is lifted high. My mouth boasts over my enemies, for I delight in your deliverance.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.2">There is no one set apart like Yahweh; there is no one besides you; there is no Rock like our God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.3">Do not keep talking so proudly or let your mouth speak such arrogance, for Yahweh is a God who knows, and by him deeds are weighed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.4">The bows of the warriors are broken, but those who stumbled are armed with strength.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.5">Those who were full hire themselves out for food, but those who were hungry are hungry no more. She who was barren has borne seven children, but she who has had many sons pines away.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.6">Yahweh brings death and makes alive; he brings down to the grave and raises up.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.7">Yahweh sends poverty and wealth; he humbles and he exalts.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.8">He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap; he seats them with princes and has them inherit a throne of honor. For the foundations of the earth are Yahweh's; on them he has set the world.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.9">He will guard the feet of his faithful servants, but the wicked will be silenced in the place of darkness. It is not by strength that one prevails;</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.10">those who oppose Yahweh will be broken. The Most High will thunder from heaven; Yahweh will judge the ends of the earth. He will give strength to his king and exalt the horn of the one who had oil poured on him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.11">Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the boy ministered before Yahweh under Eli the priest.</verse>

      <title type="sub">Eli's Wicked Sons</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.12">Eli's sons were scoundrels; they had no regard for Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.13">Now it was the practice of the priests that, whenever any of the people offered a sacrifice, the priest's servant would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand while the meat was being boiled</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.14">and would plunge the fork into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot. Whatever the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.15">But even before the fat was burned, the priest's servant would come and say to the person who was sacrificing, "Give the priest some meat to roast; he won't accept boiled meat from you, but only raw."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.16">If the person said to him, "Let the fat be burned first, and then take whatever you want," the servant would answer, "No, hand it over now; if you don't, I'll take it by force."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.17">This wrongdoing of the young men was very great in Yahweh's sight, for they were treating Yahweh's offering with contempt.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.18">But Samuel was ministering before Yahweh—a boy wearing a linen ephod.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.19">Each year his mother made him a little robe and took it to him when she went up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.20">Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, "May Yahweh give you children by this woman to take the place of the one she prayed for and gave to Yahweh." Then they would go home.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.21">And Yahweh was gracious to Hannah; she gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.22">Now Eli, who was very old, heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.23">So he said to them, "Why do you do such things? I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.24">No, my sons; the report I hear spreading among Yahweh's people is not good.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.25">If one person wrongs another, God may mediate for the offender; but if anyone wrongs Yahweh, who will intercede for them?" His sons, however, did not listen to their father's rebuke, for it was Yahweh's will to put them to death.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.26">And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with Yahweh and with people.</verse>

      <title type="sub">Prophecy Against Eli's Family</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.27">Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him, "This is what Yahweh says: 'Did I not clearly reveal myself to your ancestor's family when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh?</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.28">I chose your ancestor out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in my presence. I also gave your ancestor's family all the food offerings presented by the Israelites.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.29">Why do you scorn my sacrifice and offering that I prescribed for my dwelling? Why do you honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choice parts of every offering made by my people Israel?'</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.30">Therefore, Yahweh, the God of Israel, declares: 'I promised that members of your family would minister before me forever.' But now Yahweh declares: 'Far from it! Those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me will be disdained.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.31">The time is coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your priestly house, so that no one in it will reach old age,</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.32">and you will see distress in my dwelling. Although good will be done to Israel, no one in your family line will ever reach old age.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.33">Every one of you that I do not cut off from serving at my altar I will spare only to destroy your sight and sap your strength, and all your descendants will die in the prime of life.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.34">And what happens to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will be a sign to you—they will both die on the same day.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.35">I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who will do according to what is in my heart and mind. I will firmly establish his priestly house, and they will minister before the one who had oil poured on him always.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.36">Then everyone left in your family line will come and bow down before him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread and plead, "Appoint me to some priestly office so I can have food to eat."'"</verse>

      <title type="sub">God Calls Samuel</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.1">The boy Samuel ministered before Yahweh under Eli. In those days the word of Yahweh was rare; there were not many visions.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.2">One night Eli, whose eyes were becoming so weak that he could barely see, was lying down in his usual place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.3">The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the house of Yahweh, where the ark of God was.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.4">Then Yahweh called Samuel. Samuel answered, "Here I am."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.5">And he ran to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." But Eli said, "I did not call; go back and lie down." So he went and lay down.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.6">Again Yahweh called, "Samuel!" And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." "My son," Eli said, "I did not call; go back and lie down."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.7">Now Samuel did not yet know Yahweh: The word of Yahweh had not yet been revealed to him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.8">A third time Yahweh called, "Samuel!" And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." Then Eli realized that Yahweh was calling the boy.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.9">So Eli told Samuel, "Go and lie down, and if he calls you, say, 'Speak, Yahweh, for your servant is listening.'" So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.10">Yahweh came and stood there, calling as at the other times, "Samuel! Samuel!" Then Samuel said, "Speak, for your servant is listening."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.11">And Yahweh said to Samuel: "See, I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears about it tingle.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.12">At that time I will carry out against Eli everything I spoke against his family—from beginning to end.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.13">For I told him that I would judge his family forever because of the wrongdoing he knew about; his sons blasphemed God, and he failed to restrain them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.14">Therefore I swore to the house of Eli, 'The guilt of Eli's house will never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.15">Samuel lay down until morning and then opened the doors of the house of Yahweh. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision,</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.16">but Eli called him and said, "Samuel, my son." Samuel answered, "Here I am."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.17">"What was it he said to you?" Eli asked. "Do not hide it from me. May God deal with you, be it ever so severely, if you hide from me anything he told you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.18">So Samuel told him everything, hiding nothing from him. Then Eli said, "He is Yahweh; let him do what is good in his eyes."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.19">Yahweh was with Samuel as he grew up, and he let none of Samuel's words fall to the ground.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.20">And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba recognized that Samuel was attested as a prophet of Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.21">Yahweh continued to appear at Shiloh, and there he revealed himself to Samuel through his word.</verse>

      <title type="sub">The Ark Captured by the Philistines</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.1">And Samuel's word came to all Israel. Now the Israelites went out to fight against the Philistines. The Israelites camped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines at Aphek.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.2">The Philistines deployed their forces to meet Israel, and as the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand of them on the battlefield.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.3">When the soldiers returned to camp, the elders of Israel asked, "Why did Yahweh bring defeat on us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of Yahweh's covenant from Shiloh, so that he may go with us and save us from the hand of our enemies."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.4">So the people sent men to Shiloh, and they brought back the ark of the covenant of Yahweh Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim. And Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.5">When the ark of Yahweh's covenant came into the camp, all Israel raised such a great shout that the ground shook.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.6">Hearing the uproar, the Philistines asked, "What's all this shouting in the Hebrew camp?" When they learned that the ark of Yahweh had come into the camp,</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.7">the Philistines were afraid. "A god has come into the camp," they said. "Oh no! Nothing like this has happened before.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.8">We're doomed! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? They are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.9">Be strong, Philistines! Be men, or you will be subject to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Be men, and fight!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.10">So the Philistines fought, and the Israelites were defeated and every man fled to his tent. The slaughter was very great; Israel lost thirty thousand foot soldiers.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.11">The ark of God was captured, and Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.</verse>

      <title type="sub">Death of Eli</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.12">That same day a Benjamite ran from the battle line and went to Shiloh with his clothes torn and dust on his head.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.13">When he arrived, there was Eli sitting on his chair by the side of the road, watching, because his heart feared for the ark of God. When the man entered the town and told what had happened, the whole town cried out.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.14">Eli heard the outcry and asked, "What is the meaning of this uproar?" The man hurried over to Eli,</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.15">who was ninety-eight years old and whose eyes had failed so that he could not see.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.16">He told Eli, "I have come from the battle line; I fled from it this very day." Eli asked, "What happened, my son?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.17">The man who brought the news replied, "Israel fled before the Philistines, and the army has suffered heavy losses. Also your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.18">When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backward off his chair by the side of the gate. His neck was broken and he died, for he was an old man, and he was heavy. He had led Israel forty years.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.19">His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and near the time of delivery. When she heard the news that the ark of God had been captured and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she went into labor and gave birth, but was overcome by her labor pains.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.20">As she was dying, the women attending her said, "Don't despair; you have given birth to a son." But she did not respond or pay any attention.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.21"><note type="study" n="2">The name Ichabod means "no glory" or "the glory has departed."</note>She named the boy Ichabod, saying, "The glory has departed from Israel"—because of the capture of the ark of God and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.22">She said, "The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured."</verse>
      <chapter eID="1Sam.4"/>

      <chapter osisID="1Sam.5" sID="1Sam.5"/>
      <title type="sub">The Ark in Ashdod and Ekron</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.5.1">After the Philistines had captured the ark of God, they took it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.5.2">Then they carried the ark into Dagon's temple and set it beside Dagon.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.5.3">When the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of Yahweh! They took Dagon and put him back in his place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.5.4">But the following morning when they rose, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of Yahweh! His head and hands had been broken off and were lying on the threshold; only his body remained.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.5.5">That is why to this day neither the priests of Dagon nor any others who enter Dagon's temple at Ashdod step on the threshold.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.5.6">Yahweh's hand was heavy on the people of Ashdod and its vicinity; he brought devastation on them and afflicted them with tumors.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.5.7">When the people of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, "The ark of the god of Israel must not stay here with us, because his hand is heavy on us and on Dagon our god."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.5.8">So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and asked them, "What shall we do with the ark of the god of Israel?" They answered, "Have the ark of the god of Israel moved to Gath." So they moved the ark of the God of Israel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.5.9">But after they had moved it, Yahweh's hand was against that city, throwing it into a great panic. He afflicted the people of the city, both young and old, with an outbreak of tumors.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.5.10">So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. As the ark of God was entering Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, "They have brought the ark of the god of Israel around to us to kill us and our people."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.5.11">So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and said, "Send the ark of the god of Israel away; let it go back to its own place, or it will kill us and our people." For death had filled the city with panic; God's hand was very heavy on it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.5.12">Those who did not die were afflicted with tumors, and the outcry of the city went up to heaven.</verse>
      <chapter eID="1Sam.5"/>

      <chapter osisID="1Sam.6" sID="1Sam.6"/>
      <title type="sub">The Ark Returned to Israel</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.1">When the ark of Yahweh had been in Philistine territory seven months,</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.2">the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said, "What shall we do with the ark of Yahweh? Tell us how we should send it back to its place."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.3">They answered, "If you return the ark of the god of Israel, do not send it back to him without a gift; by all means send a guilt offering to him. Then you will be healed, and you will know why his hand has not been lifted from you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.4">The Philistines asked, "What guilt offering should we send to him?" They replied, "Five gold tumors and five gold rats, according to the number of the Philistine rulers, because the same plague has struck both you and your rulers.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.5">Make models of the tumors and of the rats that are destroying the country, and give honor to Israel's god. Perhaps he will lift his hand from you and your gods and your land.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.6">Why do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh did? When Israel's god dealt harshly with them, did they not send the Israelites out so they could go on their way?</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.7">Now then, get a new cart ready, with two cows that have calved and have never been yoked. Hitch the cows to the cart, but take their calves away and pen them up.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.8">Take the ark of Yahweh and put it on the cart, and in a chest beside it put the gold objects you are sending back to him as a guilt offering. Send it on its way,</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.9">but keep watching it. If it goes up to its own territory, toward Beth Shemesh, then Yahweh has brought this great disaster on us. But if it does not, then we will know that it was not his hand that struck us but that it happened to us by chance."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.10">So they did this. They took two such cows and hitched them to the cart and penned up their calves.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.11">They placed the ark of Yahweh on the cart and along with it the chest containing the gold rats and the models of the tumors.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.12">Then the cows went straight up toward Beth Shemesh, keeping on the road and lowing all the way; they did not turn to the right or to the left. The rulers of the Philistines followed them as far as the border of Beth Shemesh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.13">Now the people of Beth Shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley, and when they looked up and saw the ark, they rejoiced at the sight.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.14">The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and there it stopped beside a large rock. The people chopped up the wood of the cart and sacrificed the cows as a burnt offering to Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.15">The Levites took down the ark of Yahweh, together with the chest containing the gold objects, and placed them on the large rock. On that day the people of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices to Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.16">The five rulers of the Philistines saw all this and then returned that same day to Ekron.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.17">These are the gold tumors the Philistines sent as a guilt offering to Yahweh—one each for Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath and Ekron.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.18">And the number of the gold rats was according to the number of Philistine towns belonging to the five rulers—the fortified towns with their country villages. The large rock on which the Levites set the ark of Yahweh is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.19">But God struck down some of the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh, putting seventy of them to death because they looked into the ark of Yahweh. The people mourned because of the heavy blow Yahweh had dealt them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.20">And the people of Beth Shemesh asked, "Who can stand in the presence of Yahweh, this God set apart? To whom will the ark go up from here?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.21">Then they sent messengers to the people of Kiriath Jearim, saying, "The Philistines have returned the ark of Yahweh. Come down and take it up to your town."</verse>

So Samuel said to all the Israelites, "If you are returning to Yahweh with all your hearts, then rid yourselves of the foreign gods and the Ashtoreths and commit yourselves to Yahweh and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.7.4">So the Israelites put away their Baals and Ashtoreths, and served Yahweh only.</verse>

      <verse osisID="1Sam.7.6">When they had assembled at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out before Yahweh. On that day they fasted and there they confessed, "We have wronged Yahweh." Now Samuel was serving as leader of Israel at Mizpah.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.7.7">When the Philistines heard that Israel had assembled at Mizpah, the rulers of the Philistines came up to attack them. When the Israelites heard of it, they were afraid because of the Philistines.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.7.8">They said to Samuel, "Do not stop crying out to Yahweh our God for us, that he may rescue us from the hand of the Philistines."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.7.9">Then Samuel took a suckling lamb and sacrificed it as a whole burnt offering to Yahweh. He cried out to Yahweh on Israel's behalf, and Yahweh answered him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.7.10">While Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to engage Israel in battle. But that day Yahweh thundered with loud thunder against the Philistines and threw them into such a panic that they were routed before the Israelites.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.7.11">The men of Israel rushed out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, slaughtering them along the way to a point below Beth Kar.</verse>

      <verse osisID="1Sam.7.14">The towns from Ekron to Gath that the Philistines had captured from Israel were restored to Israel, and Israel delivered the neighboring territory from the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.</verse>

      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.1">There was a Benjamite, a man of standing, whose name was Kish son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bekorath, the son of Aphiah of Benjamin.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.2">Kish had a son named Saul, as handsome a young man as could be found anywhere in Israel, and he was a head taller than anyone else.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.3">Now the donkeys belonging to Saul's father Kish were lost, and Kish said to his son Saul, "Take one of the servants with you and go look for the donkeys."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.4">So he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and through the area around Shalisha, but they did not find them. They went on into the district of Shaalim, but the donkeys were not there. Then he passed through the territory of Benjamin, but they did not find them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.5">When they reached the district of Zuph, Saul said to the servant who was with him, "Come, let's go back, or my father will stop thinking about the donkeys and start worrying about us."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.6">But the servant replied, "Look, in this town there is a man of God; he is highly respected, and everything he says comes true. Let's go there now. Perhaps he will tell us what way to take."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.7">Saul said to his servant, "If we go, what can we give the man? The food in our sacks is gone. We have no gift to take to the man of God. What do we have?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.8">The servant answered him again. "Look," he said, "I have a quarter of a shekel of silver. I will give it to the man of God so that he will tell us what way to take."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.9">(Formerly in Israel, if someone went to inquire of God, they would say, "Come, let us go to the seer," because the prophet of today used to be called a seer.)</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.10">"Good," Saul said to his servant. "Come, let's go." So they set out for the town where the man of God was.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.11">As they were going up the hill to the town, they met some young women coming out to draw water, and they asked them, "Is the seer here?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.12">"He is," they answered. "He's ahead of you. Hurry now; he has just come to our town today, for the people have a sacrifice at the high place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.13">As soon as you enter the town, you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not begin eating until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; afterward, those who are invited will eat. Go up now; you should find him about this time."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.14">They went up to the town, and as they were entering it, there was Samuel, coming toward them on his way up to the high place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.15">Now the day before Saul came, Yahweh had revealed this to Samuel:</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.16">"About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin. Anoint him ruler over my people Israel; he will deliver them from the hand of the Philistines. I have looked on my people, for their cry has reached me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.17">When Samuel caught sight of Saul, Yahweh said to him, "This is the man I spoke to you about; he will govern my people."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.18">Saul approached Samuel in the gateway and asked, "Would you please tell me where the seer's house is?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.19">"I am the seer," Samuel replied. "Go up ahead of me to the high place, for today you are to eat with me, and in the morning I will send you on your way and will tell you all that is in your heart.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.20">As for the donkeys you lost three days ago, do not worry about them; they have been found. And to whom is all the desire of Israel turned, if not to you and your whole family line?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.21">Saul answered, "But am I not a Benjamite, from the smallest tribe of Israel, and is not my clan the least of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why do you say such a thing to me?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.22">Then Samuel brought Saul and his servant into the hall and seated them at the head of those who were invited—about thirty in number.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.23">Samuel said to the cook, "Bring the piece of meat I gave you, the one I told you to lay aside."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.24">So the cook took up the thigh with what was on it and set it in front of Saul. Samuel said, "Here is what has been kept for you. Eat, because it was set aside for you for this occasion from the time I said, 'I have invited guests.'" And Saul dined with Samuel that day.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.25">After they came down from the high place to the town, Samuel talked with Saul on the roof of his house.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.26">They rose about daybreak, and Samuel called to Saul on the roof, "Get ready, and I will send you on your way." When Saul got ready, he and Samuel went outside together.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.27">As they were going down to the edge of the town, Samuel said to Saul, "Tell the servant to go on ahead of us"—and the servant did so—"but you stay here for a while, so that I may give you a message from God."</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Sam.10" sID="1Sam.10"/>

      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.2">When you leave me today, you will meet two men near Rachel's tomb, at Zelzah on the border of Benjamin. They will say to you, 'The donkeys you set out to look for have been found. And now your father has stopped thinking about them and is worried about you. He is asking, "What shall I do about my son?"'</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.3">Then you will go on from there until you reach the great tree of Tabor. Three men going up to worship God at Bethel will meet you there. One will be carrying three young goats, another three loaves of bread, and another a skin of wine.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.4">They will greet you and offer you two loaves of bread, which you will accept from them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.5">After that you will go to Gibeah of God, where there is a Philistine outpost. As you approach the town, you will meet a procession of prophets coming down from the high place with lyres, timbrels, pipes and harps being played before them, and they will be prophesying.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.6">The Spirit of Yahweh will come powerfully upon you, and you will prophesy with them; and you will be changed into a different person.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.7">Once these signs are fulfilled, do whatever your hand finds to do, for God is with you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.8">Go down ahead of me to Gilgal. I will surely come down to you to sacrifice burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, but you must wait seven days until I come to you and tell you what you are to do."</verse>

      <title type="sub">Saul Made King</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.9">As Saul turned to leave Samuel, God changed Saul's heart, and all these signs were fulfilled that day.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.10">When he and his servant arrived at Gibeah, a procession of prophets met him; the Spirit of God came powerfully upon him, and he joined in their prophesying.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.11">When all those who had formerly known him saw him prophesying with the prophets, they asked each other, "What is this that has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.12">A man who lived there answered, "And who is their father?" So it became a saying: "Is Saul also among the prophets?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.13">After Saul stopped prophesying, he went to the high place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.14">Now Saul's uncle asked him and his servant, "Where have you been?" "Looking for the donkeys," he said. "But when we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.15">Saul's uncle said, "Tell me what Samuel said to you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.16">Saul replied, "He assured us that the donkeys had been found." But he did not tell his uncle what Samuel had said about the kingship.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.17">Samuel summoned the people of Israel to Yahweh at Mizpah</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.18">and said to them, "This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: 'I brought Israel up out of Egypt, and I delivered you from the power of Egypt and all the kingdoms that oppressed you.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.19">But you have now rejected your God, who saves you out of all your disasters and calamities. And you have said, 'No, appoint a king over us.' So now present yourselves before Yahweh by your tribes and clans."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.20">When Samuel had all Israel come forward by tribes, the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.21">Then he brought forward the tribe of Benjamin, clan by clan, and Matri's clan was taken. Finally Saul son of Kish was taken. But when they looked for him, he was not to be found.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.22">So they inquired further of Yahweh, "Has the man come here yet?" And Yahweh said, "Yes, he has hidden himself among the supplies."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.23">They ran and brought him out, and as he stood among the people he was a head taller than any of the others.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.24">Samuel said to all the people, "Do you see the man Yahweh has chosen? There is no one like him among all the people." Then the people shouted, "Long live the king!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.25">Samuel explained to the people the rights and duties of kingship. He wrote them down on a scroll and deposited it before Yahweh. Then Samuel dismissed the people to go to their own homes.</verse>

      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.27">But some scoundrels said, "How can this fellow save us?" They despised him and brought him no gifts. But Saul kept silent.</verse>

      <verse osisID="1Sam.12.15">But if you do not obey Yahweh, and if you rebel against his commands, his hand will be against you, as it was against your ancestors.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.12.16">Now then, stand still and see this great thing Yahweh is about to do before your eyes!</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.12.17">Is it not wheat harvest now? I will call on Yahweh to send thunder and rain. And you will realize what an evil thing you did in the eyes of Yahweh when you asked for a king."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.12.18">Then Samuel called on Yahweh, and that same day Yahweh sent thunder and rain. So all the people stood in awe of Yahweh and of Samuel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.12.19">The people all said to Samuel, "Pray to Yahweh your God for your servants so that we will not die, for we have added to all our other wrongdoings the evil of asking for a king."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.12.20">"Do not be afraid," Samuel replied. "You have done all this evil; yet do not turn away from Yahweh, but serve Yahweh with all your heart.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.12.21">Do not turn away after useless idols. They can do you no good, nor can they rescue you, because they are useless.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.12.22">For the sake of his great name Yahweh will not reject his people, because Yahweh was pleased to make you his own.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.12.23">As for me, far be it from me that I should wrong Yahweh by failing to pray for you. And I will teach you the way that is good and right.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.12.24">But be sure to fear Yahweh and serve him faithfully with all your heart; consider what great things he has done for you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.12.25">Yet if you persist in doing evil, both you and your king will perish."</verse>

      <title type="sub">Samuel Rebukes Saul</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.13.1">Saul was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned over Israel forty-two years.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.13.2">Saul chose three thousand men from Israel; two thousand were with him at Mikmash and in the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin. The rest of the men he sent back to their homes.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.13.3">Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul had the trumpet blown throughout the land and said, "Let the Hebrews hear!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.13.4">So all Israel heard the news: "Saul has attacked the Philistine outpost, and now Israel has become obnoxious to the Philistines." And the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.13.5">The Philistines assembled to fight Israel, with three thousand chariots, six thousand charioteers, and soldiers as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and camped at Mikmash, east of Beth Aven.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.13.6">When the Israelites saw that their situation was critical and that their army was hard pressed, they hid in caves and thickets, among the rocks, and in pits and cisterns.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.13.7">Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul remained at Gilgal, and all the troops with him were quaking with fear.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.13.8">He waited seven days, the time set by Samuel; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and Saul's men began to scatter.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.13.9">So he said, "Bring me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings." And Saul offered up the burnt offering.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.13.10">Just as he finished making the offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to greet him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.13.11">"What have you done?" asked Samuel. Saul replied, "When I saw that the men were scattering, and that you did not come at the set time, and that the Philistines were assembling at Mikmash,</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.13.12">I thought, 'Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought Yahweh's favor.' So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.13.13">"You have done a foolish thing," Samuel said. "You have not kept the command Yahweh your God gave you; if you had, he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.13.14">But now your kingdom will not endure; Yahweh has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him ruler of his people, because you have not kept Yahweh's command."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.13.15">Then Samuel left Gilgal and went up to Gibeah in Benjamin, and Saul counted the men who were with him. They numbered about six hundred.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.13.16">Saul and his son Jonathan and the men with them were staying in Gibeah in Benjamin, while the Philistines camped at Mikmash.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.13.17">Raiding parties went out from the Philistine camp in three detachments. One turned toward Ophrah in the vicinity of Shual,</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.13.18">another toward Beth Horon, and the third toward the borderland overlooking the Valley of Zeboyim facing the wilderness.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.13.19">Not a blacksmith could be found in the whole land of Israel, because the Philistines had said, "Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.13.20">So all Israel went down to the Philistines to have their plow points, mattocks, axes and sickles sharpened.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.13.21">The price was two-thirds of a shekel for sharpening plow points and mattocks, and a third of a shekel for sharpening forks and axes and for repointing goads.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.13.22">So on the day of the battle not a soldier with Saul and Jonathan had a sword or spear in his hand; only Saul and his son Jonathan had them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.13.23">Now a detachment of Philistines had gone out to the pass at Mikmash.</verse>
      <chapter eID="1Sam.13"/>

      <chapter osisID="1Sam.14" sID="1Sam.14"/>
      <title type="sub">Jonathan Attacks the Philistines</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.1">One day Jonathan son of Saul said to his young armor-bearer, "Come, let's go over to the Philistine outpost on the other side." But he did not tell his father.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.2">Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree in Migron. With him were about six hundred men,</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.3">among whom was Ahijah, who was wearing an ephod. He was a son of Ichabod's brother Ahitub son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, Yahweh's priest in Shiloh. No one was aware that Jonathan had left.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.4">On each side of the pass that Jonathan intended to cross to reach the Philistine outpost was a cliff; one was called Bozez and the other Seneh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.5">One cliff stood to the north toward Mikmash, the other to the south toward Geba.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.6">Jonathan said to his young armor-bearer, "Come, let's go over to the outpost of those uncircumcised men. Perhaps Yahweh will act in our behalf. Nothing can hinder Yahweh from saving, whether by many or by few."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.7">"Do all that you have in mind," his armor-bearer said. "Go ahead; I am with you heart and soul."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.8">Jonathan said, "Come then; we will cross over toward them and let them see us.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.9">If they say to us, 'Wait there until we come to you,' we will stay where we are and not go up to them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.10">But if they say, 'Come up to us,' we will climb up, because that will be our sign that Yahweh has given them into our hands."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.11">So both of them showed themselves to the Philistine outpost. "Look!" said the Philistines. "The Hebrews are crawling out of the holes they were hiding in."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.12">The men of the outpost shouted to Jonathan and his armor-bearer, "Come up to us and we'll teach you a lesson." So Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, "Climb up after me; Yahweh has given them into the hand of Israel."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.13">Jonathan climbed up, using his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer right behind him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer followed and killed behind him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.14">In that first attack Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed some twenty men in an area of about half an acre.</verse>

      <title type="sub">Israel Routs the Philistines</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.15">Then panic struck the whole army—those in the camp and field, and those in the outposts and raiding parties—and the ground shook. It was a panic sent by God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.16">Saul's lookouts at Gibeah in Benjamin saw the army melting away in all directions.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.17">Then Saul said to the men who were with him, "Muster the forces and see who has left us." When they did, it was Jonathan and his armor-bearer who were not there.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.18">Saul said to Ahijah, "Bring the ark of God." (At that time it was with the Israelites.)</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.19">While Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the Philistine camp increased more and more. So Saul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.20">Then Saul and all his men assembled and went to the battle. They found the Philistines in total confusion, striking each other with their swords.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.21">Those Hebrews who had previously been with the Philistines and had gone up with them to their camp went over to the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.22">When all the Israelites who had hidden in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were on the run, they joined the battle in hot pursuit.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.23">So on that day Yahweh saved Israel, and the battle moved on beyond Beth Aven.</verse>

      <title type="sub">Jonathan Eats Honey</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.24">Now the Israelites were in distress that day, because Saul had bound the people under an oath, saying, "Cursed be anyone who eats food before evening comes, before I have avenged myself on my enemies!" So none of the troops tasted food.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.25">The entire army entered the woods, and there was honey on the ground.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.26">When they went into the woods, they saw the honey oozing out; yet no one put his hand to his mouth, because they feared the oath.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.27">But Jonathan had not heard that his father had bound the people with the oath, so he reached out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into the honeycomb. He raised his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.28">Then one of the soldiers told him, "Your father bound the army under a strict oath, saying, 'Cursed be anyone who eats food today!' That is why the men are faint."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.29">Jonathan said, "My father has made trouble for the country. See how my eyes brightened when I tasted a little of this honey.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.30">How much better it would have been if the men had eaten freely today of the plunder they took from their enemies. Would not the slaughter of the Philistines have been even greater?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.31">That day, after the Israelites had struck down the Philistines from Mikmash to Aijalon, they were exhausted.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.32">They pounced on the plunder and, taking sheep, cattle and calves, they butchered them on the ground and ate them, together with the blood.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.33">Then someone said to Saul, "Look, the men are wronging Yahweh by eating meat that has blood in it." "You have broken faith," he said. "Roll a large stone over here at once."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.34">Then he said, "Go out among the men and tell them, 'Each of you bring me your cattle and sheep, and slaughter them here and eat them. Do not wrong Yahweh by eating meat with blood still in it.'" So everyone brought his ox that night and slaughtered it there.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.35">Then Saul built an altar to Yahweh; it was the first time he had done this.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.36">Saul said, "Let us go down and pursue the Philistines by night and plunder them till dawn, and let us not leave one of them alive." "Do whatever seems best to you," they replied. But the priest said, "Let us inquire of God here."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.37">So Saul asked God, "Shall I go down and pursue the Philistines? Will you give them into Israel's hand?" But God did not answer him that day.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.38">Saul therefore said, "Come here, all you who are leaders of the army, and let us find out what wrongdoing has been committed today.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.39">As surely as Yahweh who rescues Israel lives, even if the guilt lies with my son Jonathan, he must die." But not one of them said a word.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.40">Saul then said to all the Israelites, "You stand over there; I and Jonathan my son will stand over here." "Do what seems best to you," the men replied.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.41">Then Saul prayed to Yahweh, the God of Israel, "Why have you not answered your servant today? If the fault is in me or my son Jonathan, respond with Urim, but if the men of Israel are at fault, respond with Thummim." Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot, and the men were cleared.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.42">Saul said, "Cast the lot between me and Jonathan my son." And Jonathan was taken.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.43">Then Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me what you have done." So Jonathan told him, "I tasted a little honey with the end of my staff. And now I must die!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.44">Saul said, "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if you do not die, Jonathan."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.45">But the men said to Saul, "Should Jonathan die—he who has brought about this great deliverance in Israel? Never! As surely as Yahweh lives, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground, for he did this today with God's help." So the men rescued Jonathan, and he was not put to death.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.46">Then Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines, and they withdrew to their own land.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.47">After Saul had assumed rule over Israel, he fought against their enemies on every side: Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he inflicted punishment on them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.48">He fought valiantly and defeated the Amalekites, delivering Israel from the hands of those who had plundered them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.49">Saul's sons were Jonathan, Ishvi and Malki-Shua. The name of his older daughter was Merab, and that of the younger was Michal.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.50">His wife's name was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of Saul's army was Abner son of Ner, and Ner was Saul's uncle.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.51">Saul's father Kish and Abner's father Ner were sons of Abiel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.14.52">All the days of Saul there was bitter war with the Philistines, and whenever Saul saw a mighty or brave man, he took him into his service.</verse>

      <title type="sub">God Rejects Saul as King</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.1">Samuel said to Saul, "I am the one Yahweh sent to anoint you king over his people Israel; so listen now to the message from Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.2">This is what Yahweh Almighty says: 'I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel when they waylaid them as they came up from Egypt.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.3">Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.4">So Saul summoned the men and mustered them at Telaim—two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand from Judah.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.5">Saul went to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the ravine.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.6">Then he said to the Kenites, "Go away, leave the Amalekites so that I do not destroy you along with them; for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt." So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.7">Then Saul attacked the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to Shur, near the eastern border of Egypt.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.8">He took Agag king of the Amalekites alive, and all his people he totally destroyed with the sword.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.9">But Saul and the army spared Agag and the best of the sheep and cattle, the fat calves and lambs—everything that was good. These they were unwilling to destroy completely, but everything that was despised and weak they totally destroyed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.10">Then the word of Yahweh came to Samuel:</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.11">"I regret that I have made Saul king, because he has turned away from me and has not carried out my instructions." Samuel was angry, and he cried out to Yahweh all that night.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.12">Early in the morning Samuel got up and went to meet Saul, but he was told, "Saul has gone to Carmel. There he has set up a monument in his own honor and has turned and gone on down to Gilgal."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.13">When Samuel reached him, Saul said, "Yahweh bless you! I have carried out Yahweh's instructions."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.14">But Samuel said, "What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears? What is this lowing of cattle that I hear?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.15">Saul answered, "The soldiers brought them from the Amalekites; they spared the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice to Yahweh your God, but we totally destroyed the rest."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.16">"Enough!" Samuel said to Saul. "Let me tell you what Yahweh said to me last night." "Tell me," Saul replied.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.17">Samuel said, "Although you were once small in your own eyes, did you not become the head of the tribes of Israel? Yahweh had oil poured on you to make you king over Israel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.18">And he sent you on a mission, saying, 'Go and completely destroy those wicked people, the Amalekites; wage war against them until you have wiped them out.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.19">Why did you not obey Yahweh? Why did you pounce on the plunder and do evil in Yahweh's sight?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.20">"But I did obey Yahweh," Saul said. "I went on the mission Yahweh assigned me. I completely destroyed the Amalekites and brought back Agag their king.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.21">The soldiers took sheep and cattle from the plunder, the best of what was devoted to God, in order to sacrifice them to Yahweh your God at Gilgal."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.22">But Samuel replied: "Does Yahweh delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying Yahweh? To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.23">For rebellion is like the wrongdoing of divination, and arrogance like the evil of idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of Yahweh, he has rejected you as king."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.24">Then Saul said to Samuel, "I have wronged you. I violated Yahweh's command and your instructions. I was afraid of the men and so I gave in to them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.25">Now I beg you, forgive my wrongdoing and come back with me, so that I may worship Yahweh."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.26">But Samuel said to him, "I will not go back with you. You have rejected the word of Yahweh, and Yahweh has rejected you as king over Israel!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.27">As Samuel turned to leave, Saul caught hold of the hem of his robe, and it tore.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.28">Samuel said to him, "Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to one of your neighbors—to one better than you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.29">He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind; for he is not a human being, that he should change his mind."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.30">Saul replied, "I have wronged you, but please honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel; come back with me, so that I may worship Yahweh your God."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.31">So Samuel went back with Saul, and Saul worshiped Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.32">Then Samuel said, "Bring me Agag king of the Amalekites." Agag came to him in chains. And Agag said, "Surely the bitterness of death is past."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.33">But Samuel said, "As your sword has made women childless, so will your mother be childless among women." And Samuel put Agag to death before Yahweh at Gilgal.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.34">Then Samuel left for Ramah, but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.15.35">Until the day Samuel died, he did not go to see Saul again, though Samuel mourned for him. And Yahweh regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel.</verse>

      <title type="sub">Samuel Anoints David</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.16.1">Yahweh said to Samuel, "How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him as king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and be on your way; I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem. I have chosen one of his sons to be king."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.16.2">But Samuel said, "How can I go? If Saul hears about it, he will kill me." Yahweh said, "Take a heifer with you and say, 'I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.16.3">Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what to do. You are to anoint for me the one I indicate."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.16.4">Samuel did what Yahweh said. When he arrived at Bethlehem, the elders of the town trembled when they met him. They asked, "Do you come in peace?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.16.5">Samuel replied, "Yes, in peace; I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh. Consecrate yourselves and come to the sacrifice with me." Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.16.6">When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and thought, "Surely the one Yahweh had oil poured on stands here before him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.16.7">But Yahweh said to Samuel, "Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. Yahweh does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but Yahweh looks at the heart."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.16.8">Then Jesse called Abinadab and had him pass in front of Samuel. But Samuel said, "Yahweh has not chosen this one either."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.16.9">Jesse then had Shammah pass by, but Samuel said, "Nor has Yahweh chosen this one."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.16.10">Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to him, "Yahweh has not chosen these."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.16.11">So he asked Jesse, "Are these all the sons you have?" "There is still the youngest," Jesse answered. "He is tending the sheep." Samuel said, "Send for him; we will not sit down until he arrives."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.16.12">So he sent for him and had him brought in. He was glowing with health and had a fine appearance and handsome features. Then Yahweh said, "Rise and anoint him; this is the one."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.16.13">So Samuel took the horn of oil and had oil poured on him in the presence of his brothers, and from that day on the Spirit of Yahweh came powerfully upon David. Samuel then went to Ramah.</verse>

      <verse osisID="1Sam.16.17">So Saul said to his attendants, "Find someone who plays well and bring him to me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.16.18">One of the servants answered, "I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem who knows how to play the lyre. He is a brave man and a warrior. He speaks well and is a fine-looking man. And Yahweh is with him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.16.19">Then Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, "Send me your son David, who is with the sheep."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.16.20">So Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them with his son David to Saul.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.16.21">David came to Saul and entered his service. Saul liked him very much, and David became one of his armor-bearers.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.16.22">Then Saul sent word to Jesse, saying, "Allow David to remain in my service, because I am pleased with him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.16.23">Whenever the spirit from God came on Saul, David would take up his lyre and play. Then relief would come to Saul; he would feel better, and the evil spirit would leave him.</verse>

      <title type="sub">David and Goliath</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.1">Now the Philistines gathered their forces for war and assembled at Sokoh in Judah. They pitched camp at Ephes Dammim, between Sokoh and Azekah.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.2">Saul and the Israelites assembled and camped in the Valley of Elah and drew up their battle line to meet the Philistines.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.3">The Philistines occupied one hill and the Israelites another, with the valley between them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.4"><note type="study" n="4">Goliath was over nine feet tall.</note>A champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out of the Philistine camp. His height was six cubits and a span.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.5">He had a bronze helmet on his head and wore a coat of scale armor of bronze weighing five thousand shekels;</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.6">on his legs he wore bronze greaves, and a bronze javelin was slung on his back.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.7">His spear shaft was like a weaver's rod, and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels. His shield bearer went ahead of him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.8">Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, "Why do you come out and line up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose a man and have him come down to me.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.9">If he is able to fight and kill me, we will become your subjects; but if I overcome him and kill him, you will become our subjects and serve us."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.10">Then the Philistine said, "This day I defy the armies of Israel! Give me a man and let us fight each other."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.11">On hearing the Philistine's words, Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and terrified.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.12">Now David was the son of an Ephrathite named Jesse, who was from Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight sons, and in Saul's time he was very old.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.13">Jesse's three oldest sons had followed Saul to the war: The firstborn was Eliab; the second, Abinadab; and the third, Shammah.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.14">David was the youngest. The three oldest followed Saul,</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.15">but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father's sheep at Bethlehem.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.16">For forty days the Philistine came forward every morning and evening and took his stand.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.17">Now Jesse said to his son David, "Take this roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread for your brothers and hurry to their camp.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.18">Take along these ten cheeses to the commander of their unit. See how your brothers are and bring back some assurance from them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.19">They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.20">Early in the morning David left the flock in the care of a shepherd, loaded up and set out, as Jesse had directed. He reached the camp as the army was going out to its battle positions, shouting the war cry.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.21">Israel and the Philistines were drawing up their lines facing each other.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.22">David left his things with the keeper of supplies, ran to the battle lines and asked his brothers how they were.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.23">As he was talking with them, Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath, stepped out from his lines and shouted his usual defiance, and David heard it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.24">Whenever the Israelites saw the man, they all fled from him in great fear.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.25">Now the Israelites had been saying, "Do you see how this man keeps coming out? He comes out to defy Israel. The king will give great wealth to the man who kills him. He will also give him his daughter in marriage and will exempt his family from taxes in Israel."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.26">David asked the men standing near him, "What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.27">They repeated to him what they had been saying and told him, "This is what will be done for the man who kills him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.28">When Eliab, David's oldest brother, heard him speaking with the men, he burned with anger at him and asked, "Why have you come down here? And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness? I know how conceited you are and how wicked your heart is; you came down only to watch the battle."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.29">"Now what have I done?" said David. "Can't I even speak?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.30">He then turned away to someone else and brought up the same matter, and the men answered him as before.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.31">What David said was overheard and reported to Saul, and Saul sent for him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.32">David said to Saul, "Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine; your servant will go and fight him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.33">Saul replied, "You are not able to go out against this Philistine and fight him; you are only a young man, and he has been a warrior from his youth."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.34">But David said to Saul, "Your servant has been keeping his father's sheep. When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock,</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.35">I went after it, struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth. When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair, struck it and killed it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.36">Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.37">Yahweh who rescued me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine." Saul said to David, "Go, and Yahweh be with you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.38">Then Saul dressed David in his own tunic. He put a coat of armor on him and a bronze helmet on his head.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.39">David fastened on his sword over the tunic and tried walking around, because he was not used to them. "I cannot go in these," he said to Saul, "because I am not used to them." So he took them off.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.40">Then he took his staff in his hand, chose five smooth stones from the stream, put them in the pouch of his shepherd's bag and, with his sling in his hand, approached the Philistine.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.41">Meanwhile, the Philistine, with his shield bearer in front of him, kept coming closer to David.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.42">He looked David over and saw that he was little more than a boy, glowing with health and handsome, and he despised him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.43">He said to David, "Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks?" And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.44">"Come here," he said, "and I'll give your flesh to the birds and the wild animals!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.45">David said to the Philistine, "You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of Yahweh Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.46">This day Yahweh will deliver you into my hands, and I'll strike you down and cut off your head. This very day I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds and the wild animals, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.47">All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that Yahweh saves; for the battle is Yahweh's, and he will give all of you into our hands."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.48">As the Philistine moved closer to attack him, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.49">Reaching into his bag and taking out a stone, he slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.50">So David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; without a sword in his hand he struck down the Philistine and killed him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.51">David ran and stood over him. He took hold of the Philistine's sword and drew it from the sheath. After he killed him, he cut off his head with the sword. When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they turned and ran.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.52">Then the men of Israel and Judah surged forward with a shout and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of Gath and to the gates of Ekron. Their dead were strewn along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.53">When the Israelites returned from chasing the Philistines, they plundered their camp.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.54">David took the Philistine's head and brought it to Jerusalem; he put the Philistine's weapons in his own tent.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.55">As Saul watched David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, commander of the army, "Abner, whose son is that young man?" Abner replied, "As surely as you live, Your Majesty, I don't know."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.56">The king said, "Find out whose son this young man is."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.57">As soon as David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul, with David still holding the Philistine's head.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.17.58">"Whose son are you, young man?" Saul asked him. David said, "I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem."</verse>

      <title type="sub">Saul's Growing Fear of David</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.1">After David had finished talking with Saul, Jonathan became one in spirit with David, and he loved him as himself.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.2">From that day Saul kept David with him and did not let him return home to his family.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.3">And Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.4">Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his tunic, and even his sword, his bow and his belt.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.5">Whatever mission Saul sent him on, David was so successful that Saul gave him a high rank in the army. This pleased all the troops, and Saul's officers as well.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.6">When the men were returning home after David had killed the Philistine, the women came out from all the towns of Israel to meet King Saul with singing and dancing, with joyful songs and with timbrels and lyres.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.7">As they danced, they sang: "Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.8">Saul was very angry; this refrain displeased him greatly. "They have credited David with tens of thousands," he thought, "but me with only thousands. What more can he get but the kingdom?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.9">And from that time on Saul kept a close eye on David.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.10">The next day an evil spirit from God came forcefully on Saul. He was prophesying in his house, while David was playing the lyre, as he usually did. Saul had a spear in his hand</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.11">and he hurled it, saying to himself, "I'll pin David to the wall." But David eluded him twice.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.12">Saul was afraid of David, because Yahweh was with David but had departed from Saul.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.13">So he sent David away from him and gave him command over a thousand men, and David led the troops in their campaigns.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.14">In everything he did he had great success, because Yahweh was with him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.15">When Saul saw how successful he was, he was afraid of him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.16">But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he led them in their campaigns.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.17">Saul said to David, "Here is my older daughter Merab. I will give her to you in marriage; only serve me bravely and fight the battles of Yahweh." For Saul said to himself, "I will not raise a hand against him. Let the Philistines do that!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.18">But David said to Saul, "Who am I, and what is my family or my clan in Israel, that I should become the king's son-in-law?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.19">So when the time came for Merab, Saul's daughter, to be given to David, she was given in marriage to Adriel of Meholah instead.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.20">Now Saul's daughter Michal was in love with David, and when they told Saul about it, he was pleased.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.21">"I will give her to him," he thought, "so that she may be a snare to him and so that the hand of the Philistines may be against him." So Saul said to David, "Now you have a second opportunity to become my son-in-law."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.22">Then Saul ordered his attendants: "Speak to David privately and say, 'Look, the king likes you, and his attendants all love you; now become his son-in-law.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.23">They repeated these words to David. But David said, "Do you think it is a small matter to become the king's son-in-law? I'm only a poor man and little known."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.24">When Saul's servants told him what David had said,</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.25">Saul replied, "Say to David, 'The king wants no other price for the bride than a hundred Philistine foreskins, to take revenge on his enemies.'" Saul's plan was to have David fall by the hands of the Philistines.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.26">When the attendants told David these things, he was pleased to become the king's son-in-law. So before the allotted time elapsed,</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.27">David took his men with him and went out and killed two hundred Philistines and brought back their foreskins. They counted out the full number to the king so that David might become the king's son-in-law. Then Saul gave him his daughter Michal in marriage.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.28">When Saul realized that Yahweh was with David and that his daughter Michal loved David,</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.29">Saul became still more afraid of him, and he remained his enemy the rest of his days.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.18.30">The Philistine commanders continued to go out to battle, and as often as they did, David met with more success than the rest of Saul's officers, and his name became well known.</verse>

      <title type="sub">Saul Tries to Kill David</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.19.1">Saul told his son Jonathan and all the attendants to kill David. But Jonathan had taken a great liking to David</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.19.2">and warned him, "My father Saul is looking for a chance to kill you. Be on your guard tomorrow morning; go into hiding and stay there.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.19.3">I will go out and stand with my father in the field where you are. I'll speak to him about you and will tell you what I find out."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.19.4">Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, "Let not the king do wrong to his servant David; he has not wronged you, and what he has done has benefited you greatly.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.19.5">He took his life in his hands when he killed the Philistine. Yahweh won a great victory for all Israel, and you saw it and were glad. Why then would you do wrong to an innocent man like David by killing him for no reason?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.19.6">Saul listened to Jonathan and took this oath: "As surely as Yahweh lives, David will not be put to death."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.19.7">So Jonathan called David and told him the whole conversation. He brought him to Saul, and David was with Saul as before.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.19.8">Once more war broke out, and David went out and fought the Philistines. He struck them with such force that they fled before him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.19.9">But an evil spirit from Yahweh came on Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand. While David was playing the lyre,</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.19.10">Saul tried to pin him to the wall with his spear, but David eluded him as Saul drove the spear into the wall. That night David made good his escape.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.19.11">Saul sent men to David's house to watch it and to kill him in the morning. But Michal, David's wife, warned him, "If you don't run for your life tonight, tomorrow you'll be killed."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.19.12">So Michal let David down through a window, and he fled and escaped.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.19.13">Then Michal took an idol and laid it on the bed, covering it with a garment and putting some goats' hair at the head.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.19.14">When Saul sent the men to capture David, Michal said, "He is ill."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.19.15">Then Saul sent the men back to see David and told them, "Bring him up to me in his bed so that I may kill him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.19.16">But when the men entered, there was the idol in the bed, and at the head was some goats' hair.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.19.17">Saul said to Michal, "Why did you deceive me like this and send my enemy away so that he escaped?" Michal told him, "He said to me, 'Let me get away. Why should I kill you?'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.19.18">When David had fled and made his escape, he went to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.19.19">Word came to Saul: "David is in Naioth at Ramah";</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.19.20">so he sent men to capture him. But when they saw a group of prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing there as their leader, the Spirit of God came on Saul's men, and they also prophesied.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.19.21">Saul was told about it, and he sent more men, and they prophesied too. Saul sent men a third time, and they also prophesied.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.19.22">Finally, he himself left for Ramah and went to the great cistern at Seku. And he asked, "Where are Samuel and David?" "Over in Naioth at Ramah," they said.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.19.23">So Saul went to Naioth at Ramah. But the Spirit of God came even on him, and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.19.24">He stripped off his garments, and he too prophesied in Samuel's presence. He lay naked all that day and all that night. This is why people say, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"</verse>

      <title type="sub">David and Jonathan's Covenant</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.1">Then David fled from Naioth at Ramah and went to Jonathan and asked, "What have I done? What is my crime? How have I wronged your father, that he is trying to kill me?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.2">"Never!" Jonathan replied. "You are not going to die! Look, my father doesn't do anything, great or small, without letting me know. Why would he hide this from me? It isn't so!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.3">But David took an oath and said, "Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said to himself, 'Jonathan must not know this or he will be grieved.' Yet as surely as Yahweh lives and as you live, there is only a step between me and death."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.4">Jonathan said to David, "Whatever you want me to do, I'll do for you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.5">So David said, "Look, tomorrow is the New Moon celebration, and I am supposed to dine with the king; but let me go and hide in the field until the evening of the day after tomorrow.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.6">If your father misses me at all, tell him, 'David earnestly asked my permission to hurry to Bethlehem, his hometown, because an annual sacrifice is being made there for his whole clan.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.7">If he says, 'Very well,' then your servant is safe. But if he loses his temper, you can be sure that he is determined to harm me.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.8">As for you, show kindness to your servant, for you have brought him into a covenant with you before Yahweh. If I am guilty of anything, kill me yourself! Why hand me over to your father?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.9">"Never!" Jonathan said. "If I had the least inkling that my father was determined to harm you, wouldn't I tell you?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.10">David asked, "Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.11">"Come," Jonathan said, "let's go out into the field." So they went there together.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.12">Then Jonathan said to David, "I swear by Yahweh, the God of Israel, that I will surely sound out my father by this time the day after tomorrow! If he is favorably disposed toward you, will I not send you word and let you know?</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.13">But if my father intends to harm you, may Yahweh deal with Jonathan, be it ever so severely, if I do not let you know and send you away in peace. May Yahweh be with you as he has been with my father.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.14">But show me unfailing kindness like the kindness of Yahweh as long as I live, so that I may not be killed,</verse>

      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.22">But if I say to the boy, 'Look, the arrows are beyond you,' then you must go, because Yahweh has sent you away.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.23">And about the matter you and I discussed—remember, Yahweh is witness between you and me forever."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.24">So David hid in the field, and when the New Moon celebration came, the king sat down to eat.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.25">He sat in his customary place by the wall, opposite Jonathan, and Abner sat next to Saul, but David's place was empty.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.26">Saul said nothing that day, for he thought, "Something must have happened to David to make him ceremonially unclean—surely he is unclean."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.27">But the next day, the second day of the month, David's place was empty again. Then Saul said to his son Jonathan, "Why hasn't the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.28">Jonathan answered, "David earnestly asked me for permission to go to Bethlehem.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.29">He said, 'Let me go, because our family is observing a sacrifice in the town and my brother has ordered me to be there. If I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away to see my brothers.' That is why he has not come to the king's table."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.30">Saul's anger flared up at Jonathan and he said to him, "You son of a perverse and rebellious woman! Don't I know that you have sided with the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of the mother who bore you?</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.31">As long as the son of Jesse lives on this earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now send someone to bring him to me, for he must die!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.32">"Why should he be put to death? What has he done?" Jonathan asked his father.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.33">But Saul hurled his spear at him to kill him. Then Jonathan knew that his father intended to kill David.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.34">Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger; on that second day of the feast he did not eat, because he was grieved at his father's shameful treatment of David.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.35">In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for his meeting with David. He had a small boy with him,</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.36">and he said to the boy, "Run and find the arrows I shoot." As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.37">When the boy came to the place where Jonathan's arrow had fallen, Jonathan called out after him, "Isn't the arrow beyond you?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.38">Then he shouted, "Hurry! Go quickly! Don't stop!" The boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.39">(The boy knew nothing about all this; only Jonathan and David knew.)</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.40">Then Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and said, "Go, carry them back to town."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.41">After the boy had gone, David got up from the south side of the stone and bowed down before Jonathan three times, with his face to the ground. Then they kissed each other and wept together—but David wept the most.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.20.42">Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace, for we have sworn friendship with each other in the name of Yahweh, saying, 'Yahweh is witness between you and me, and between your descendants and my descendants forever.'" Then David left, and Jonathan went back to the town.</verse>
