      <title type="sub">Hannah's Prayer for a Son</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.1">There was a certain man from Ramathaim, a Zuphite from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.2">He had two wives; one was called Hannah and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.3">Year after year this man went up from his town to worship and sacrifice to Yahweh Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests of Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.4">Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.5">But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her, and Yahweh had closed her womb.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.6">Because Yahweh had closed Hannah's womb, her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.7">This went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of Yahweh, her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.8">Her husband Elkanah would say to her, "Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don't you eat? Why are you downhearted? Don't I mean more to you than ten sons?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.9">Once when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his chair by the doorpost of Yahweh's temple.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.10">In her deep anguish Hannah prayed to Yahweh, weeping bitterly.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.11">And she made a vow, saying, "Yahweh Almighty, if you will only look on your servant's misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to Yahweh for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used on his head."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.12">As she kept on praying to Yahweh, Eli observed her mouth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.13">Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard. Eli thought she was drunk</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.14">and said to her, "How long are you going to stay drunk? Put away your wine."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.15">"Not so, my lord," Hannah replied, "I am a woman who is deeply troubled. I have not been drinking wine or beer; I was pouring out my soul to Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.16">Do not take your servant for a wicked woman; I have been praying here out of my great anguish and grief."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.17">Eli answered, "Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked of him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.18">She said, "May your servant find favor in your eyes." Then she went her way and ate something, and her face was no longer downcast.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.19">Early the next morning they arose and worshiped before Yahweh and then went back to their home at Ramah. Elkanah made love to his wife Hannah, and Yahweh remembered her.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.20"><note type="study" n="1">The name Samuel sounds like the Hebrew for "heard by God."</note>So in the course of time Hannah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, saying, "Because I asked Yahweh for him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.21">When her husband Elkanah went up with all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to Yahweh and to fulfill his vow,</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.22">Hannah did not go. She said to her husband, "After the boy is weaned, I will take him and present him before Yahweh, and he will live there always."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.23">"Do what seems best to you," her husband Elkanah told her. "Stay here until you have weaned him; only may Yahweh make good his word." So the woman stayed at home and nursed her son until she had weaned him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.24">After he was weaned, she took the boy with her, young as he was, along with a three-year-old bull, about twenty-two pounds of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of Yahweh at Shiloh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.25">When the bull had been sacrificed, they brought the boy to Eli,</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.26">and she said to him, "Pardon me, my lord. As surely as you live, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.27">I prayed for this child, and Yahweh has granted me what I asked of him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.1.28">So now I give him to Yahweh. For his whole life he will be given over to Yahweh." And he worshiped Yahweh there.</verse>
      <chapter eID="1Sam.1"/>

      <chapter osisID="1Sam.2" sID="1Sam.2"/>
      <title type="sub">Hannah's Prayer of Praise</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.1">Then Hannah prayed and said: "My heart rejoices in Yahweh; in Yahweh my horn is lifted high. My mouth boasts over my enemies, for I delight in your deliverance.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.2">There is no one set apart like Yahweh; there is no one besides you; there is no Rock like our God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.3">Do not keep talking so proudly or let your mouth speak such arrogance, for Yahweh is a God who knows, and by him deeds are weighed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.4">The bows of the warriors are broken, but those who stumbled are armed with strength.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.5">Those who were full hire themselves out for food, but those who were hungry are hungry no more. She who was barren has borne seven children, but she who has had many sons pines away.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.6">Yahweh brings death and makes alive; he brings down to the grave and raises up.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.7">Yahweh sends poverty and wealth; he humbles and he exalts.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.8">He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap; he seats them with princes and has them inherit a throne of honor. For the foundations of the earth are Yahweh's; on them he has set the world.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.9">He will guard the feet of his faithful servants, but the wicked will be silenced in the place of darkness. It is not by strength that one prevails;</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.10">those who oppose Yahweh will be broken. The Most High will thunder from heaven; Yahweh will judge the ends of the earth. He will give strength to his king and exalt the horn of his anointed one."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.11">Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the boy ministered before Yahweh under Eli the priest.</verse>

      <title type="sub">Eli's Wicked Sons</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.12">Eli's sons were scoundrels; they had no regard for Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.13">Now it was the practice of the priests that, whenever any of the people offered a sacrifice, the priest's servant would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand while the meat was being boiled</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.14">and would plunge the fork into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot. Whatever the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.15">But even before the fat was burned, the priest's servant would come and say to the person who was sacrificing, "Give the priest some meat to roast; he won't accept boiled meat from you, but only raw."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.16">If the person said to him, "Let the fat be burned first, and then take whatever you want," the servant would answer, "No, hand it over now; if you don't, I'll take it by force."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.17">This wrongdoing of the young men was very great in Yahweh's sight, for they were treating Yahweh's offering with contempt.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.18">But Samuel was ministering before Yahweh—a boy wearing a linen ephod.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.19">Each year his mother made him a little robe and took it to him when she went up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.20">Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, "May Yahweh give you children by this woman to take the place of the one she prayed for and gave to Yahweh." Then they would go home.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.21">And Yahweh was gracious to Hannah; she gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.22">Now Eli, who was very old, heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.23">So he said to them, "Why do you do such things? I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.24">No, my sons; the report I hear spreading among Yahweh's people is not good.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.25">If one person wrongs another, God may mediate for the offender; but if anyone wrongs Yahweh, who will intercede for them?" His sons, however, did not listen to their father's rebuke, for it was Yahweh's will to put them to death.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.26">And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with Yahweh and with people.</verse>

      <title type="sub">Prophecy Against Eli's Family</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.27">Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him, "This is what Yahweh says: 'Did I not clearly reveal myself to your ancestor's family when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh?</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.28">I chose your ancestor out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in my presence. I also gave your ancestor's family all the food offerings presented by the Israelites.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.29">Why do you scorn my sacrifice and offering that I prescribed for my dwelling? Why do you honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choice parts of every offering made by my people Israel?'</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.30">Therefore, Yahweh, the God of Israel, declares: 'I promised that members of your family would minister before me forever.' But now Yahweh declares: 'Far from it! Those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me will be disdained.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.31">The time is coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your priestly house, so that no one in it will reach old age,</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.32">and you will see distress in my dwelling. Although good will be done to Israel, no one in your family line will ever reach old age.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.33">Every one of you that I do not cut off from serving at my altar I will spare only to destroy your sight and sap your strength, and all your descendants will die in the prime of life.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.34">And what happens to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will be a sign to you—they will both die on the same day.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.35">I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who will do according to what is in my heart and mind. I will firmly establish his priestly house, and they will minister before my anointed one always.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.2.36">Then everyone left in your family line will come and bow down before him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread and plead, "Appoint me to some priestly office so I can have food to eat."'"</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Sam.3" sID="1Sam.3"/>
      <title type="sub">God Calls Samuel</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.1">The boy Samuel ministered before Yahweh under Eli. In those days the word of Yahweh was rare; there were not many visions.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.2">One night Eli, whose eyes were becoming so weak that he could barely see, was lying down in his usual place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.3">The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the house of Yahweh, where the ark of God was.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.4">Then Yahweh called Samuel. Samuel answered, "Here I am."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.5">And he ran to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." But Eli said, "I did not call; go back and lie down." So he went and lay down.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.6">Again Yahweh called, "Samuel!" And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." "My son," Eli said, "I did not call; go back and lie down."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.7">Now Samuel did not yet know Yahweh: The word of Yahweh had not yet been revealed to him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.8">A third time Yahweh called, "Samuel!" And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." Then Eli realized that Yahweh was calling the boy.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.9">So Eli told Samuel, "Go and lie down, and if he calls you, say, 'Speak, Yahweh, for your servant is listening.'" So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.10">Yahweh came and stood there, calling as at the other times, "Samuel! Samuel!" Then Samuel said, "Speak, for your servant is listening."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.11">And Yahweh said to Samuel: "See, I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears about it tingle.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.12">At that time I will carry out against Eli everything I spoke against his family—from beginning to end.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.13">For I told him that I would judge his family forever because of the wrongdoing he knew about; his sons blasphemed God, and he failed to restrain them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.14">Therefore I swore to the house of Eli, 'The guilt of Eli's house will never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.15">Samuel lay down until morning and then opened the doors of the house of Yahweh. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision,</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.16">but Eli called him and said, "Samuel, my son." Samuel answered, "Here I am."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.17">"What was it he said to you?" Eli asked. "Do not hide it from me. May God deal with you, be it ever so severely, if you hide from me anything he told you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.18">So Samuel told him everything, hiding nothing from him. Then Eli said, "He is Yahweh; let him do what is good in his eyes."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.19">Yahweh was with Samuel as he grew up, and he let none of Samuel's words fall to the ground.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.20">And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba recognized that Samuel was attested as a prophet of Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.3.21">Yahweh continued to appear at Shiloh, and there he revealed himself to Samuel through his word.</verse>

      <title type="sub">The Ark Captured by the Philistines</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.1">And Samuel's word came to all Israel. Now the Israelites went out to fight against the Philistines. The Israelites camped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines at Aphek.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.2">The Philistines deployed their forces to meet Israel, and as the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand of them on the battlefield.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.3">When the soldiers returned to camp, the elders of Israel asked, "Why did Yahweh bring defeat on us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of Yahweh's covenant from Shiloh, so that he may go with us and save us from the hand of our enemies."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.4">So the people sent men to Shiloh, and they brought back the ark of the covenant of Yahweh Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim. And Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.5">When the ark of Yahweh's covenant came into the camp, all Israel raised such a great shout that the ground shook.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.6">Hearing the uproar, the Philistines asked, "What's all this shouting in the Hebrew camp?" When they learned that the ark of Yahweh had come into the camp,</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.7">the Philistines were afraid. "A god has come into the camp," they said. "Oh no! Nothing like this has happened before.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.8">We're doomed! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? They are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.9">Be strong, Philistines! Be men, or you will be subject to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Be men, and fight!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.10">So the Philistines fought, and the Israelites were defeated and every man fled to his tent. The slaughter was very great; Israel lost thirty thousand foot soldiers.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.11">The ark of God was captured, and Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.</verse>

      <title type="sub">Death of Eli</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.12">That same day a Benjamite ran from the battle line and went to Shiloh with his clothes torn and dust on his head.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.13">When he arrived, there was Eli sitting on his chair by the side of the road, watching, because his heart feared for the ark of God. When the man entered the town and told what had happened, the whole town cried out.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.14">Eli heard the outcry and asked, "What is the meaning of this uproar?" The man hurried over to Eli,</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.15">who was ninety-eight years old and whose eyes had failed so that he could not see.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.16">He told Eli, "I have come from the battle line; I fled from it this very day." Eli asked, "What happened, my son?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.17">The man who brought the news replied, "Israel fled before the Philistines, and the army has suffered heavy losses. Also your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.18">When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backward off his chair by the side of the gate. His neck was broken and he died, for he was an old man, and he was heavy. He had led Israel forty years.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.19">His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and near the time of delivery. When she heard the news that the ark of God had been captured and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she went into labor and gave birth, but was overcome by her labor pains.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.20">As she was dying, the women attending her said, "Don't despair; you have given birth to a son." But she did not respond or pay any attention.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.21"><note type="study" n="2">The name Ichabod means "no glory" or "the glory has departed."</note>She named the boy Ichabod, saying, "The glory has departed from Israel"—because of the capture of the ark of God and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.4.22">She said, "The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured."</verse>
      <chapter eID="1Sam.4"/>

      <chapter osisID="1Sam.5" sID="1Sam.5"/>
      <title type="sub">The Ark in Ashdod and Ekron</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.5.1">After the Philistines had captured the ark of God, they took it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.5.2">Then they carried the ark into Dagon's temple and set it beside Dagon.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.5.3">When the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of Yahweh! They took Dagon and put him back in his place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.5.4">But the following morning when they rose, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of Yahweh! His head and hands had been broken off and were lying on the threshold; only his body remained.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.5.5">That is why to this day neither the priests of Dagon nor any others who enter Dagon's temple at Ashdod step on the threshold.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.5.6">Yahweh's hand was heavy on the people of Ashdod and its vicinity; he brought devastation on them and afflicted them with tumors.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.5.7">When the people of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, "The ark of the god of Israel must not stay here with us, because his hand is heavy on us and on Dagon our god."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.5.8">So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and asked them, "What shall we do with the ark of the god of Israel?" They answered, "Have the ark of the god of Israel moved to Gath." So they moved the ark of the God of Israel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.5.9">But after they had moved it, Yahweh's hand was against that city, throwing it into a great panic. He afflicted the people of the city, both young and old, with an outbreak of tumors.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.5.10">So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. As the ark of God was entering Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, "They have brought the ark of the god of Israel around to us to kill us and our people."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.5.11">So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and said, "Send the ark of the god of Israel away; let it go back to its own place, or it will kill us and our people." For death had filled the city with panic; God's hand was very heavy on it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.5.12">Those who did not die were afflicted with tumors, and the outcry of the city went up to heaven.</verse>
      <chapter eID="1Sam.5"/>

      <chapter osisID="1Sam.6" sID="1Sam.6"/>
      <title type="sub">The Ark Returned to Israel</title>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.1">When the ark of Yahweh had been in Philistine territory seven months,</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.2">the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said, "What shall we do with the ark of Yahweh? Tell us how we should send it back to its place."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.3">They answered, "If you return the ark of the god of Israel, do not send it back to him without a gift; by all means send a guilt offering to him. Then you will be healed, and you will know why his hand has not been lifted from you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.4">The Philistines asked, "What guilt offering should we send to him?" They replied, "Five gold tumors and five gold rats, according to the number of the Philistine rulers, because the same plague has struck both you and your rulers.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.5">Make models of the tumors and of the rats that are destroying the country, and give honor to Israel's god. Perhaps he will lift his hand from you and your gods and your land.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.6">Why do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh did? When Israel's god dealt harshly with them, did they not send the Israelites out so they could go on their way?</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.7">Now then, get a new cart ready, with two cows that have calved and have never been yoked. Hitch the cows to the cart, but take their calves away and pen them up.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.8">Take the ark of Yahweh and put it on the cart, and in a chest beside it put the gold objects you are sending back to him as a guilt offering. Send it on its way,</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.9">but keep watching it. If it goes up to its own territory, toward Beth Shemesh, then Yahweh has brought this great disaster on us. But if it does not, then we will know that it was not his hand that struck us but that it happened to us by chance."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.10">So they did this. They took two such cows and hitched them to the cart and penned up their calves.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.11">They placed the ark of Yahweh on the cart and along with it the chest containing the gold rats and the models of the tumors.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.12">Then the cows went straight up toward Beth Shemesh, keeping on the road and lowing all the way; they did not turn to the right or to the left. The rulers of the Philistines followed them as far as the border of Beth Shemesh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.13">Now the people of Beth Shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley, and when they looked up and saw the ark, they rejoiced at the sight.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.14">The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and there it stopped beside a large rock. The people chopped up the wood of the cart and sacrificed the cows as a burnt offering to Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.15">The Levites took down the ark of Yahweh, together with the chest containing the gold objects, and placed them on the large rock. On that day the people of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices to Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.16">The five rulers of the Philistines saw all this and then returned that same day to Ekron.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.17">These are the gold tumors the Philistines sent as a guilt offering to Yahweh—one each for Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath and Ekron.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.18">And the number of the gold rats was according to the number of Philistine towns belonging to the five rulers—the fortified towns with their country villages. The large rock on which the Levites set the ark of Yahweh is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.19">But God struck down some of the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh, putting seventy of them to death because they looked into the ark of Yahweh. The people mourned because of the heavy blow Yahweh had dealt them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.20">And the people of Beth Shemesh asked, "Who can stand in the presence of Yahweh, this holy God? To whom will the ark go up from here?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.6.21">Then they sent messengers to the people of Kiriath Jearim, saying, "The Philistines have returned the ark of Yahweh. Come down and take it up to your town."</verse>

      <verse osisID="1Sam.7.4">So the Israelites put away their Baals and Ashtoreths, and served Yahweh only.</verse>

      <verse osisID="1Sam.7.6">When they had assembled at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out before Yahweh. On that day they fasted and there they confessed, "We have wronged Yahweh." Now Samuel was serving as leader of Israel at Mizpah.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.7.7">When the Philistines heard that Israel had assembled at Mizpah, the rulers of the Philistines came up to attack them. When the Israelites heard of it, they were afraid because of the Philistines.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.7.8">They said to Samuel, "Do not stop crying out to Yahweh our God for us, that he may rescue us from the hand of the Philistines."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.7.9">Then Samuel took a suckling lamb and sacrificed it as a whole burnt offering to Yahweh. He cried out to Yahweh on Israel's behalf, and Yahweh answered him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.7.10">While Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to engage Israel in battle. But that day Yahweh thundered with loud thunder against the Philistines and threw them into such a panic that they were routed before the Israelites.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.7.11">The men of Israel rushed out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, slaughtering them along the way to a point below Beth Kar.</verse>

      <verse osisID="1Sam.7.14">The towns from Ekron to Gath that the Philistines had captured from Israel were restored to Israel, and Israel delivered the neighboring territory from the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.</verse>

      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.1">There was a Benjamite, a man of standing, whose name was Kish son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bekorath, the son of Aphiah of Benjamin.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.2">Kish had a son named Saul, as handsome a young man as could be found anywhere in Israel, and he was a head taller than anyone else.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.3">Now the donkeys belonging to Saul's father Kish were lost, and Kish said to his son Saul, "Take one of the servants with you and go look for the donkeys."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.4">So he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and through the area around Shalisha, but they did not find them. They went on into the district of Shaalim, but the donkeys were not there. Then he passed through the territory of Benjamin, but they did not find them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.5">When they reached the district of Zuph, Saul said to the servant who was with him, "Come, let's go back, or my father will stop thinking about the donkeys and start worrying about us."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.6">But the servant replied, "Look, in this town there is a man of God; he is highly respected, and everything he says comes true. Let's go there now. Perhaps he will tell us what way to take."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.7">Saul said to his servant, "If we go, what can we give the man? The food in our sacks is gone. We have no gift to take to the man of God. What do we have?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.8">The servant answered him again. "Look," he said, "I have a quarter of a shekel of silver. I will give it to the man of God so that he will tell us what way to take."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.9">(Formerly in Israel, if someone went to inquire of God, they would say, "Come, let us go to the seer," because the prophet of today used to be called a seer.)</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.10">"Good," Saul said to his servant. "Come, let's go." So they set out for the town where the man of God was.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.11">As they were going up the hill to the town, they met some young women coming out to draw water, and they asked them, "Is the seer here?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.12">"He is," they answered. "He's ahead of you. Hurry now; he has just come to our town today, for the people have a sacrifice at the high place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.13">As soon as you enter the town, you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not begin eating until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; afterward, those who are invited will eat. Go up now; you should find him about this time."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.14">They went up to the town, and as they were entering it, there was Samuel, coming toward them on his way up to the high place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.15">Now the day before Saul came, Yahweh had revealed this to Samuel:</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.16">"About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin. Anoint him ruler over my people Israel; he will deliver them from the hand of the Philistines. I have looked on my people, for their cry has reached me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.17">When Samuel caught sight of Saul, Yahweh said to him, "This is the man I spoke to you about; he will govern my people."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.18">Saul approached Samuel in the gateway and asked, "Would you please tell me where the seer's house is?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.19">"I am the seer," Samuel replied. "Go up ahead of me to the high place, for today you are to eat with me, and in the morning I will send you on your way and will tell you all that is in your heart.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.20">As for the donkeys you lost three days ago, do not worry about them; they have been found. And to whom is all the desire of Israel turned, if not to you and your whole family line?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.21">Saul answered, "But am I not a Benjamite, from the smallest tribe of Israel, and is not my clan the least of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why do you say such a thing to me?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.22">Then Samuel brought Saul and his servant into the hall and seated them at the head of those who were invited—about thirty in number.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.23">Samuel said to the cook, "Bring the piece of meat I gave you, the one I told you to lay aside."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.24">So the cook took up the thigh with what was on it and set it in front of Saul. Samuel said, "Here is what has been kept for you. Eat, because it was set aside for you for this occasion from the time I said, 'I have invited guests.'" And Saul dined with Samuel that day.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.25">After they came down from the high place to the town, Samuel talked with Saul on the roof of his house.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.26">They rose about daybreak, and Samuel called to Saul on the roof, "Get ready, and I will send you on your way." When Saul got ready, he and Samuel went outside together.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.9.27">As they were going down to the edge of the town, Samuel said to Saul, "Tell the servant to go on ahead of us"—and the servant did so—"but you stay here for a while, so that I may give you a message from God."</verse>

      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.2">When you leave me today, you will meet two men near Rachel's tomb, at Zelzah on the border of Benjamin. They will say to you, 'The donkeys you set out to look for have been found. And now your father has stopped thinking about them and is worried about you. He is asking, "What shall I do about my son?"'</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.3">Then you will go on from there until you reach the great tree of Tabor. Three men going up to worship God at Bethel will meet you there. One will be carrying three young goats, another three loaves of bread, and another a skin of wine.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.4">They will greet you and offer you two loaves of bread, which you will accept from them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.5">After that you will go to Gibeah of God, where there is a Philistine outpost. As you approach the town, you will meet a procession of prophets coming down from the high place with lyres, timbrels, pipes and harps being played before them, and they will be prophesying.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.6">The Spirit of Yahweh will come powerfully upon you, and you will prophesy with them; and you will be changed into a different person.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.7">Once these signs are fulfilled, do whatever your hand finds to do, for God is with you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.8">Go down ahead of me to Gilgal. I will surely come down to you to sacrifice burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, but you must wait seven days until I come to you and tell you what you are to do."</verse>

      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.10">When he and his servant arrived at Gibeah, a procession of prophets met him; the Spirit of God came powerfully upon him, and he joined in their prophesying.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.11">When all those who had formerly known him saw him prophesying with the prophets, they asked each other, "What is this that has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.12">A man who lived there answered, "And who is their father?" So it became a saying: "Is Saul also among the prophets?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.13">After Saul stopped prophesying, he went to the high place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.14">Now Saul's uncle asked him and his servant, "Where have you been?" "Looking for the donkeys," he said. "But when we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.15">Saul's uncle said, "Tell me what Samuel said to you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.16">Saul replied, "He assured us that the donkeys had been found." But he did not tell his uncle what Samuel had said about the kingship.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.17">Samuel summoned the people of Israel to Yahweh at Mizpah</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.18">and said to them, "This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: 'I brought Israel up out of Egypt, and I delivered you from the power of Egypt and all the kingdoms that oppressed you.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.19">But you have now rejected your God, who saves you out of all your disasters and calamities. And you have said, 'No, appoint a king over us.' So now present yourselves before Yahweh by your tribes and clans."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.20">When Samuel had all Israel come forward by tribes, the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.21">Then he brought forward the tribe of Benjamin, clan by clan, and Matri's clan was taken. Finally Saul son of Kish was taken. But when they looked for him, he was not to be found.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.22">So they inquired further of Yahweh, "Has the man come here yet?" And Yahweh said, "Yes, he has hidden himself among the supplies."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.23">They ran and brought him out, and as he stood among the people he was a head taller than any of the others.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.24">Samuel said to all the people, "Do you see the man Yahweh has chosen? There is no one like him among all the people." Then the people shouted, "Long live the king!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.10.25">Samuel explained to the people the rights and duties of kingship. He wrote them down on a scroll and deposited it before Yahweh. Then Samuel dismissed the people to go to their own homes.</verse>

      <verse osisID="1Sam.12.15">But if you do not obey Yahweh, and if you rebel against his commands, his hand will be against you, as it was against your ancestors.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.12.16">Now then, stand still and see this great thing Yahweh is about to do before your eyes!</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.12.17">Is it not wheat harvest now? I will call on Yahweh to send thunder and rain. And you will realize what an evil thing you did in the eyes of Yahweh when you asked for a king."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.12.18">Then Samuel called on Yahweh, and that same day Yahweh sent thunder and rain. So all the people stood in awe of Yahweh and of Samuel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.12.19">The people all said to Samuel, "Pray to Yahweh your God for your servants so that we will not die, for we have added to all our other wrongdoings the evil of asking for a king."</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.12.20">"Do not be afraid," Samuel replied. "You have done all this evil; yet do not turn away from Yahweh, but serve Yahweh with all your heart.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.12.21">Do not turn away after useless idols. They can do you no good, nor can they rescue you, because they are useless.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.12.22">For the sake of his great name Yahweh will not reject his people, because Yahweh was pleased to make you his own.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.12.23">As for me, far be it from me that I should wrong Yahweh by failing to pray for you. And I will teach you the way that is good and right.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.12.24">But be sure to fear Yahweh and serve him faithfully with all your heart; consider what great things he has done for you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="1Sam.12.25">Yet if you persist in doing evil, both you and your king will perish."</verse>
