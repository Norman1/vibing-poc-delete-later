        <title type="main">Rebuilding God's House Takes Priority</title>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.1.1">In the second year of King Darius, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the word of Yahweh came by the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying:</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.1.2">This is what Yahweh of armies says: These people say, "The time has not come to rebuild the house of Yahweh."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.1.3">Then the word of Yahweh came by the prophet Haggai, saying:</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.1.4">Is it time for you yourselves to live in your paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins?</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.1.5">Now this is what Yahweh of armies says: Give careful thought to your ways.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.1.6">You have planted much but harvested little. You eat but never have enough. You drink but never have your fill. You put on clothes but are not warm. And the one who earns wages earns them to put them into a purse with holes.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.1.7">This is what Yahweh of armies says: Give careful thought to your ways.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.1.8">Go up into the mountains and bring down timber and build the house, so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored, says Yahweh.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.1.9">You expected much, but see, it turned out to be little. What you brought home, I blew away. Why? declares Yahweh of armies. Because of my house, which remains a ruin, while each of you is busy with your own house.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.1.10">Therefore the heavens above you withhold their dew and the earth withholds its crops.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.1.11">I called for a drought on the fields and the mountains, on the grain, the new wine, the olive oil and everything else the ground produces, on people and livestock, and on all the labor of your hands.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">The People Respond</title>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.1.12">Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Joshua son of Jehozadak the high priest, and the whole remnant of the people obeyed the voice of Yahweh their God and the message of the prophet Haggai, because Yahweh their God had sent him. And the people feared Yahweh.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.1.13">Then Haggai, Yahweh's messenger, gave this message of Yahweh to the people: "I am with you," declares Yahweh.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.1.14">So Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, the spirit of Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of the whole remnant of the people. They came and began to work on the house of Yahweh of armies, their God,</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.1.15">on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month in the second year of King Darius.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Hag.2.1">On the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the word of Yahweh came through the prophet Haggai:</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.2.2">Speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people. Ask them,</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.2.3">'Who of you is left who saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Does it not seem to you like nothing?</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.2.4">But now be strong, Zerubbabel,' declares Yahweh. 'Be strong, Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land,' declares Yahweh, 'and work. For I am with you,' declares Yahweh of armies.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.2.5">'This is what I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt. And my Spirit remains among you. Do not fear.'</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.2.6">This is what Yahweh of armies says: 'In a little while I will once more shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.2.7">I will shake all nations, and what is desired by all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory,' says Yahweh of armies.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.2.8">'The silver is mine and the gold is mine,' declares Yahweh of armies.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.2.9">'The glory of this present house will be greater than the glory of the former house,' says Yahweh of armies. 'And in this place I will grant peace,' declares Yahweh of armies.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Hag.2.10">On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of Yahweh came to the prophet Haggai:</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.2.11">This is what Yahweh of armies says: 'Ask the priests what the law says:</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.2.12">If someone carries set apart<note type="translation">The Hebrew word "qodesh" means something dedicated or set apart for God</note> meat in the fold of their garment, and that fold touches some bread or stew, some wine, olive oil or other food, does it become set apart?' The priests answered, 'No.'</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.2.13">Then Haggai said, 'If a person defiled by contact with a dead body touches one of these things, does it become defiled?' 'Yes,' the priests replied, 'it becomes defiled.'</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.2.14">Then Haggai said, 'So it is with this people and this nation in my sight,' declares Yahweh. 'Whatever they do and whatever they offer there is defiled.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.2.15">Now give careful thought to this from this day onâ€”consider how things were before one stone was laid on another in Yahweh's temple.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.2.16">When anyone came to a heap of twenty measures, there were only ten. When anyone went to a wine vat to draw fifty measures, there were only twenty.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.2.17">I struck all the work of your hands with blight, mildew and hail, yet you did not return to me,' declares Yahweh.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.2.18">'From this day on, from this twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, give careful thought to the day when the foundation of Yahweh's temple was laid. Give careful thought:</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.2.19">Is there yet any seed left in the barn? Until now, the vine and the fig tree, the pomegranate and the olive tree have not borne fruit. From this day on I will bless you.'</verse>

        <verse osisID="Hag.2.20">The word of Yahweh came to Haggai a second time on the twenty-fourth day of the month:</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.2.21">Tell Zerubbabel governor of Judah that I am going to shake the heavens and the earth.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.2.22">I will overturn royal thrones and shatter the power of the foreign kingdoms. I will overthrow chariots and their drivers; horses and their riders will fall, each by the sword of his brother.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Hag.2.23">On that day,' declares Yahweh of armies, 'I will take you, my servant Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel,' declares Yahweh, 'and I will make you like my signet ring, for I have chosen you,' declares Yahweh of armies.</verse>
