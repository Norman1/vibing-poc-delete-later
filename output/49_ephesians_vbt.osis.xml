      <div type="introduction">
        <p>Ephesians reveals God's grand plan to unite all things in Christ, showing how Jewish and Gentile believers are brought together as one body. Paul explains the spiritual blessings believers have received in Christ and how this should transform their relationships in marriage, family, and society. This letter emphasizes the church as God's masterpiece, created to display his wisdom and grace to the spiritual powers in the heavenly realms.</p>

      <title type="sub">Opening Greeting</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.1.1" sID="Eph.1.1" />Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, to God's people who are in Ephesus and are faithful in Christ Jesus:<verse eID="Eph.1.1" /> <verse osisID="Eph.1.2" sID="Eph.1.2" />Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<verse eID="Eph.1.2" />
      
      <title type="sub">Praise for Spiritual Blessings in Christ</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.1.3" sID="Eph.1.3" />Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ.<verse eID="Eph.1.3" /> <verse osisID="Eph.1.4" sID="Eph.1.4" />For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be set apart for God and blameless in his sight. In love<verse eID="Eph.1.4" /> <verse osisID="Eph.1.5" sID="Eph.1.5" />he predestined us for adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will—<verse eID="Eph.1.5" /> <verse osisID="Eph.1.6" sID="Eph.1.6" />to the praise of his glorious grace, which he has freely given us in the One he loves.<verse eID="Eph.1.6" /> <verse osisID="Eph.1.7" sID="Eph.1.7" />In him we have buying back through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God's grace<verse eID="Eph.1.7" /> <verse osisID="Eph.1.8" sID="Eph.1.8" />that he lavished on us. With all wisdom and understanding,<verse eID="Eph.1.8" /> <verse osisID="Eph.1.9" sID="Eph.1.9" />he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ,<verse eID="Eph.1.9" /> <verse osisID="Eph.1.10" sID="Eph.1.10" />to be put into effect when the times reach their fulfillment—to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ.<verse eID="Eph.1.10" />
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.1.11" sID="Eph.1.11" />In him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will,<verse eID="Eph.1.11" /> <verse osisID="Eph.1.12" sID="Eph.1.12" />in order that we, who were the first to put our hope in Christ, might be for the praise of his glory.<verse eID="Eph.1.12" /> <verse osisID="Eph.1.13" sID="Eph.1.13" />And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the good news of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Spirit that sets people apart for God,<verse eID="Eph.1.13" /> <verse osisID="Eph.1.14" sID="Eph.1.14" />who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the buying back of those who are God's possession—to the praise of his glory.<verse eID="Eph.1.14" />
      
      <title type="sub">Thanksgiving and Prayer</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.1.15" sID="Eph.1.15" />For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all God's people,<verse eID="Eph.1.15" /> <verse osisID="Eph.1.16" sID="Eph.1.16" />I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers.<verse eID="Eph.1.16" /> <verse osisID="Eph.1.17" sID="Eph.1.17" />I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better.<verse eID="Eph.1.17" /> <verse osisID="Eph.1.18" sID="Eph.1.18" />I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in his people set apart for God,<verse eID="Eph.1.18" /> <verse osisID="Eph.1.19" sID="Eph.1.19" />and his incomparably great power for us who believe. That power is the same as the mighty strength<verse eID="Eph.1.19" /> <verse osisID="Eph.1.20" sID="Eph.1.20" />he exerted when he raised Christ from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms,<verse eID="Eph.1.20" /> <verse osisID="Eph.1.21" sID="Eph.1.21" />far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every name that is invoked, not only in the present age but also in the one to come.<verse eID="Eph.1.21" /> <verse osisID="Eph.1.22" sID="Eph.1.22" />And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church,<verse eID="Eph.1.22" /> <verse osisID="Eph.1.23" sID="Eph.1.23" />which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.<verse eID="Eph.1.23" />

      <title type="sub">Made Alive in Christ</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.2.1" sID="Eph.2.1" />As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins,<verse eID="Eph.2.1" /> <verse osisID="Eph.2.2" sID="Eph.2.2" />in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient.<verse eID="Eph.2.2" /> <verse osisID="Eph.2.3" sID="Eph.2.3" />All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our flesh and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature deserving of anger.<verse eID="Eph.2.3" />
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.2.4" sID="Eph.2.4" />But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy,<verse eID="Eph.2.4" /> <verse osisID="Eph.2.5" sID="Eph.2.5" />made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you have been saved.<verse eID="Eph.2.5" /> <verse osisID="Eph.2.6" sID="Eph.2.6" />And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus,<verse eID="Eph.2.6" /> <verse osisID="Eph.2.7" sID="Eph.2.7" />in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.<verse eID="Eph.2.7" /> <verse osisID="Eph.2.8" sID="Eph.2.8" />For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—<verse eID="Eph.2.8" /> <verse osisID="Eph.2.9" sID="Eph.2.9" />not by works, so that no one can boast.<verse eID="Eph.2.9" /> <verse osisID="Eph.2.10" sID="Eph.2.10" />For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.<verse eID="Eph.2.10" />
      
      <title type="sub">Jew and Gentile Reconciled Through Christ</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.2.11" sID="Eph.2.11" />Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called "uncircumcised" by those who call themselves "the circumcision" (which is done in the body by human hands)—<verse eID="Eph.2.11" /> <verse osisID="Eph.2.12" sID="Eph.2.12" />remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world.<verse eID="Eph.2.12" /> <verse osisID="Eph.2.13" sID="Eph.2.13" />But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ.<verse eID="Eph.2.13" />
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.2.14" sID="Eph.2.14" />For he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility,<verse eID="Eph.2.14" /> <verse osisID="Eph.2.15" sID="Eph.2.15" />by setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out of the two, thus making peace,<verse eID="Eph.2.15" /> <verse osisID="Eph.2.16" sID="Eph.2.16" />and in one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he put to death their hostility.<verse eID="Eph.2.16" /> <verse osisID="Eph.2.17" sID="Eph.2.17" />He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near.<verse eID="Eph.2.17" /> <verse osisID="Eph.2.18" sID="Eph.2.18" />For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit.<verse eID="Eph.2.18" />
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.2.19" sID="Eph.2.19" />Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God's people and also members of his household,<verse eID="Eph.2.19" /> <verse osisID="Eph.2.20" sID="Eph.2.20" />built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone.<verse eID="Eph.2.20" /> <verse osisID="Eph.2.21" sID="Eph.2.21" />In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a temple set apart for God in the Lord.<verse eID="Eph.2.21" /> <verse osisID="Eph.2.22" sID="Eph.2.22" />And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit.<verse eID="Eph.2.22" />

      <title type="sub">God's Marvelous Plan for the Gentiles</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.3.1" sID="Eph.3.1" />For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles—<verse eID="Eph.3.1" />
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.3.2" sID="Eph.3.2" />Surely you have heard about the administration of God's grace that was given to me for you,<verse eID="Eph.3.2" /> <verse osisID="Eph.3.3" sID="Eph.3.3" />that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly.<verse eID="Eph.3.3" /> <verse osisID="Eph.3.4" sID="Eph.3.4" />In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,<verse eID="Eph.3.4" /> <verse osisID="Eph.3.5" sID="Eph.3.5" />which was not made known to people in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God's apostles and prophets set apart for God.<verse eID="Eph.3.5" /> <verse osisID="Eph.3.6" sID="Eph.3.6" />This mystery is that through the good news the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.<verse eID="Eph.3.6" />
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.3.7" sID="Eph.3.7" />I became a servant of this good news by the gift of God's grace given me through the working of his power.<verse eID="Eph.3.7" /> <verse osisID="Eph.3.8" sID="Eph.3.8" />Although I am less than the least of all the Lord's people, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the boundless riches of Christ,<verse eID="Eph.3.8" /> <verse osisID="Eph.3.9" sID="Eph.3.9" />and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things.<verse eID="Eph.3.9" /> <verse osisID="Eph.3.10" sID="Eph.3.10" />His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,<verse eID="Eph.3.10" /> <verse osisID="Eph.3.11" sID="Eph.3.11" />according to his eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.<verse eID="Eph.3.11" /> <verse osisID="Eph.3.12" sID="Eph.3.12" />In him and through faith in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence.<verse eID="Eph.3.12" /> <verse osisID="Eph.3.13" sID="Eph.3.13" />I ask you, therefore, not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory.<verse eID="Eph.3.13" />
      
      <title type="sub">Paul's Prayer for the Ephesians</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.3.14" sID="Eph.3.14" />For this reason I kneel before the Father,<verse eID="Eph.3.14" /> <verse osisID="Eph.3.15" sID="Eph.3.15" />from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name.<verse eID="Eph.3.15" /> <verse osisID="Eph.3.16" sID="Eph.3.16" />I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being,<verse eID="Eph.3.16" /> <verse osisID="Eph.3.17" sID="Eph.3.17" />so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love,<verse eID="Eph.3.17" /> <verse osisID="Eph.3.18" sID="Eph.3.18" />may have power, together with all the Lord's people set apart for God, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ,<verse eID="Eph.3.18" /> <verse osisID="Eph.3.19" sID="Eph.3.19" />and to know this love that surpasses knowledge—that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.<verse eID="Eph.3.19" />
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.3.20" sID="Eph.3.20" />Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us,<verse eID="Eph.3.20" /> <verse osisID="Eph.3.21" sID="Eph.3.21" />to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen.<verse eID="Eph.3.21" />

      <title type="sub">Unity and Maturity in the Body of Christ</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.4.1" sID="Eph.4.1" />As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received.<verse eID="Eph.4.1" /> <verse osisID="Eph.4.2" sID="Eph.4.2" />Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love.<verse eID="Eph.4.2" /> <verse osisID="Eph.4.3" sID="Eph.4.3" />Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.<verse eID="Eph.4.3" /> <verse osisID="Eph.4.4" sID="Eph.4.4" />There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called;<verse eID="Eph.4.4" /> <verse osisID="Eph.4.5" sID="Eph.4.5" />one Lord, one faith, one baptism;<verse eID="Eph.4.5" /> <verse osisID="Eph.4.6" sID="Eph.4.6" />one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.<verse eID="Eph.4.6" />
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.4.7" sID="Eph.4.7" />But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it.<verse eID="Eph.4.7" /> <verse osisID="Eph.4.8" sID="Eph.4.8" />This is why it says: "When he ascended on high, he took many captives and gave gifts to his people."<verse eID="Eph.4.8" />
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.4.9" sID="Eph.4.9" />(What does "he ascended" mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions?<verse eID="Eph.4.9" /> <verse osisID="Eph.4.10" sID="Eph.4.10" />He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.)<verse eID="Eph.4.10" /> <verse osisID="Eph.4.11" sID="Eph.4.11" />So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers,<verse eID="Eph.4.11" /> <verse osisID="Eph.4.12" sID="Eph.4.12" />to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up<verse eID="Eph.4.12" /> <verse osisID="Eph.4.13" sID="Eph.4.13" />until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.<verse eID="Eph.4.13" />
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.4.14" sID="Eph.4.14" />Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming.<verse eID="Eph.4.14" /> <verse osisID="Eph.4.15" sID="Eph.4.15" />Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ.<verse eID="Eph.4.15" /> <verse osisID="Eph.4.16" sID="Eph.4.16" />From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.<verse eID="Eph.4.16" />
      
      <title type="sub">Instructions for Christian Living</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.4.17" sID="Eph.4.17" />So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking.<verse eID="Eph.4.17" /> <verse osisID="Eph.4.18" sID="Eph.4.18" />They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts.<verse eID="Eph.4.18" /> <verse osisID="Eph.4.19" sID="Eph.4.19" />Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, and they are full of greed.<verse eID="Eph.4.19" />
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.4.20" sID="Eph.4.20" />That, however, is not the way of life you learned when you heard about Christ,<verse eID="Eph.4.20" /> <verse osisID="Eph.4.21" sID="Eph.4.21" />surely you heard of him and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus.<verse eID="Eph.4.21" /> <verse osisID="Eph.4.22" sID="Eph.4.22" />You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires;<verse eID="Eph.4.22" /> <verse osisID="Eph.4.23" sID="Eph.4.23" />to be made new in the attitude of your minds;<verse eID="Eph.4.23" /> <verse osisID="Eph.4.24" sID="Eph.4.24" />and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true doing what's right and being set apart for him.<verse eID="Eph.4.24" />
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.4.25" sID="Eph.4.25" />Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor, for we are all members of one body.<verse eID="Eph.4.25" /> <verse osisID="Eph.4.26" sID="Eph.4.26" />"In your anger do not sin": Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry,<verse eID="Eph.4.26" /> <verse osisID="Eph.4.27" sID="Eph.4.27" />and do not give the devil a foothold.<verse eID="Eph.4.27" /> <verse osisID="Eph.4.28" sID="Eph.4.28" />Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with their own hands, that they may have something to share with those in need.<verse eID="Eph.4.28" />
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.4.29" sID="Eph.4.29" />Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.<verse eID="Eph.4.29" /> <verse osisID="Eph.4.30" sID="Eph.4.30" />And do not grieve the Spirit that sets people apart for God, with whom you were sealed for the day of buying back.<verse eID="Eph.4.30" /> <verse osisID="Eph.4.31" sID="Eph.4.31" />Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice.<verse eID="Eph.4.31" /> <verse osisID="Eph.4.32" sID="Eph.4.32" />Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.<verse eID="Eph.4.32" />
      
      <chapter eID="Eph.4" />
      
      <chapter osisID="Eph.5" sID="Eph.5" />
      <verse osisID="Eph.5.1" sID="Eph.5.1" />Follow God's example, therefore, as dearly loved children<verse eID="Eph.5.1" /> <verse osisID="Eph.5.2" sID="Eph.5.2" />and walk in the way of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.<verse eID="Eph.5.2" />
      
      <title type="sub">Living as Children of Light</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.5.3" sID="Eph.5.3" />But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual sin, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God's people set apart for him.<verse eID="Eph.5.3" /> <verse osisID="Eph.5.4" sID="Eph.5.4" />Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving.<verse eID="Eph.5.4" /> <verse osisID="Eph.5.5" sID="Eph.5.5" />For of this you can be sure: No sexually immoral, impure or greedy person—such a person is an idolater—has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.<verse eID="Eph.5.5" /> <verse osisID="Eph.5.6" sID="Eph.5.6" />Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God's anger comes on those who are disobedient.<verse eID="Eph.5.6" /> <verse osisID="Eph.5.7" sID="Eph.5.7" />Therefore do not be partners with them.<verse eID="Eph.5.7" />
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.5.8" sID="Eph.5.8" />For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light<verse eID="Eph.5.8" /> <verse osisID="Eph.5.9" sID="Eph.5.9" />(for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, doing what's right and truth)<verse eID="Eph.5.9" /> <verse osisID="Eph.5.10" sID="Eph.5.10" />and find out what pleases the Lord.<verse eID="Eph.5.10" /> <verse osisID="Eph.5.11" sID="Eph.5.11" />Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.<verse eID="Eph.5.11" /> <verse osisID="Eph.5.12" sID="Eph.5.12" />It is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret.<verse eID="Eph.5.12" /> <verse osisID="Eph.5.13" sID="Eph.5.13" />But everything exposed by the light becomes visible—and everything that is illuminated becomes a light.<verse eID="Eph.5.13" /> <verse osisID="Eph.5.14" sID="Eph.5.14" />This is why it is said: "Wake up, sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you."<verse eID="Eph.5.14" />
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.5.15" sID="Eph.5.15" />Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise,<verse eID="Eph.5.15" /> <verse osisID="Eph.5.16" sID="Eph.5.16" />making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.<verse eID="Eph.5.16" /> <verse osisID="Eph.5.17" sID="Eph.5.17" />Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is.<verse eID="Eph.5.17" /> <verse osisID="Eph.5.18" sID="Eph.5.18" />Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit,<verse eID="Eph.5.18" /> <verse osisID="Eph.5.19" sID="Eph.5.19" />speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit. Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord,<verse eID="Eph.5.19" /> <verse osisID="Eph.5.20" sID="Eph.5.20" />always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.<verse eID="Eph.5.20" />
      
      <title type="sub">Instructions for Christian Households</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.5.21" sID="Eph.5.21" />Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.<verse eID="Eph.5.21" />
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.5.22" sID="Eph.5.22" />Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord.<verse eID="Eph.5.22" /> <verse osisID="Eph.5.23" sID="Eph.5.23" />For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior.<verse eID="Eph.5.23" /> <verse osisID="Eph.5.24" sID="Eph.5.24" />Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.<verse eID="Eph.5.24" />
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.5.25" sID="Eph.5.25" />Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her<verse eID="Eph.5.25" /> <verse osisID="Eph.5.26" sID="Eph.5.26" />to make her set apart for God, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,<verse eID="Eph.5.26" /> <verse osisID="Eph.5.27" sID="Eph.5.27" />and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but set apart for God and blameless.<verse eID="Eph.5.27" /> <verse osisID="Eph.5.28" sID="Eph.5.28" />In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.<verse eID="Eph.5.28" /> <verse osisID="Eph.5.29" sID="Eph.5.29" />After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church—<verse eID="Eph.5.29" /> <verse osisID="Eph.5.30" sID="Eph.5.30" />for we are members of his body.<verse eID="Eph.5.30" /> <verse osisID="Eph.5.31" sID="Eph.5.31" />"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh."<verse eID="Eph.5.31" /> <verse osisID="Eph.5.32" sID="Eph.5.32" />This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church.<verse eID="Eph.5.32" /> <verse osisID="Eph.5.33" sID="Eph.5.33" />However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.<verse eID="Eph.5.33" />

      <verse osisID="Eph.6.5" sID="Eph.6.5" />Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ.<verse eID="Eph.6.5" /> <verse osisID="Eph.6.6" sID="Eph.6.6" />Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart.<verse eID="Eph.6.6" /> <verse osisID="Eph.6.7" sID="Eph.6.7" />Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not people,<verse eID="Eph.6.7" /> <verse osisID="Eph.6.8" sID="Eph.6.8" />because you know that the Lord will reward each one for whatever good they do, whether they are slave or free.<verse eID="Eph.6.8" />
      
      <verse osisID="Eph.6.9" sID="Eph.6.9" />And masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Do not threaten them, since you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with him.<verse eID="Eph.6.9" />
