      <verse osisID="Matt.2.3">When King Herod heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.4">And gathering all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ was to be born.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.5">They told him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is what has been written through the prophet:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.6">'And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.'"</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.2.13">After they had left, look, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you. For Herod is about to search for the child to destroy him."</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.2.21">So he got up, took the child and his mother, and entered the land of Israel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.22">But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee.</verse>

      <title type="sub">Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.1">At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.2">When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.3">He answered, "Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.4">He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread—which was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.5">Or haven't you read in the Law that the priests on Sabbath duty in the temple desecrate the Sabbath and yet are innocent?</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.12.8">For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.9">Going on from that place, he went into their synagogue,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.10">and a man with a shriveled hand was there. Looking for a reason to bring charges against Jesus, they asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.11">He said to them, "If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.12">How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.13">Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other.</verse>

      <title type="sub">God's Chosen Servant</title>

      <verse osisID="Matt.12.16">He warned them not to tell others about him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.17">This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:</verse>

      <title type="sub">The Parable of the Sower</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.1">On that day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.2">Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people stood on the shore.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.3">Then he told them many things in parables, saying: "A farmer went out to sow his seed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.4">As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.5">Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.6">But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.7">Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.8">Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.9">Whoever has ears, let them hear."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.10">The disciples came to him and asked, "Why do you speak to the people in parables?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.11">He replied, "Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.12">Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.13">This is why I speak to them in parables: Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.14">In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: 'You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.15">For this people's heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.16">But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.17">For truly I tell you, many prophets and people who did what was right longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Parable of the Sower Explained</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.18">"Listen then to what the parable of the sower means:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.19">When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along the path.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.20">The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.21">But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.22">The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.23">But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Parable of the Weeds</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.24">Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.25">But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.26">When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.27">"The owner's servants came to him and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.28">"'An enemy did this,' he replied. "The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.29">"'No,' he answered, 'because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.30">Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.'"</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.31">He told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed<note type="translation">The mustard seed was the smallest seed known in that region</note>, which a man took and planted in his field.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.32">Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.33">He told them still another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds<note type="translation">The Greek word "sata" refers to about three measures, approximately 60 pounds of flour</note> of flour until it worked all through the dough."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.34">Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.35">So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: "I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Parable of the Weeds Explained</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.36">Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.37">He answered, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.38">The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the people of the kingdom. The weeds are the people of the evil one,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.39">and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.40">"As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.41">The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.42">They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.43">Then those who do what's right will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears, let them hear.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Parables of the Hidden Treasure and the Pearl</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.44">"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.45">"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.13.48">When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.13.49">This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from those who do what's right</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.13.55">"Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary, and aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas?</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.14.1">At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.2">and he said to his attendants, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.3">Now Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.4">for John had been saying to him: "It is not lawful for you to have her."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.5">Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of the people, because they considered John a prophet.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.6">On Herod's birthday the daughter of Herodias danced for the guests and pleased Herod so much</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.7">that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.8">Prompted by her mother, she said, "Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist."</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.14.10">and had John beheaded in the prison.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.11">His head was brought in on a platter and given to the girl, who carried it to her mother.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.12">John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.13">When Jesus heard what had happened, he withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place. Hearing of this, the crowds followed him on foot from the towns.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.14">When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them and healed their sick.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.15">As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.16">Jesus replied, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.17">"We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish," they answered.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.18">"Bring them here to me," he said.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.19">And he directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.20">They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.21">The number of those who ate was about five thousand men, besides women and children.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Walks on the Water</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.22">Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.23">After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.24">and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.25">Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.26">When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. "It's a ghost," they said, and cried out in fear.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.27">But Jesus immediately said to them: "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.28">"Lord, if it's you," Peter replied, "tell me to come to you on the water."</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.14.31">Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.32">And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.33">Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.34">When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.14.35">And when the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word to all the surrounding country. People brought all their sick to him</verse>

      <title type="main">That Which Defiles</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.1">Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.2">"Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They don't wash their hands before they eat!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.3">Jesus replied, "And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.4">For God said, 'Honor your father and mother' and 'Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.5">But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is 'devoted to God,'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.6">they are not to 'honor their father or mother' with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.7">You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.8">'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.9">They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.10">Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.11">What goes into someone's mouth does not defile them, but what comes out of their mouth, that is what defiles them."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.12">Then the disciples came to him and asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.13">He replied, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.14">Leave them; they are blind guides. If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.15">Peter said, "Explain the parable to us."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.16">"Are you still so dull?" Jesus asked them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.17">"Don't you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.18">But the things that come out of a person's mouth come from the heart, and these defile them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.19">For out of the heart come evil thoughts—murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.20">These are what defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile them."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Faith of a Canaanite Woman</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.21">Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.22">A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is demon-possessed and suffering terribly."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.23">Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, "Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.24">He answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.25">The woman came and knelt before him. "Lord, help me!" she said.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.26">He replied, "It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.27">"Yes it is, Lord," she said. "Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.28">Then Jesus said to her, "Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted." And her daughter was healed at that moment.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.29">Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.30">Great crowds came to him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute and many others, and laid them at his feet; and he healed them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.31">The people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled made well, the lame walking and the blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.32">Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.33">His disciples answered, "Where could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.34">"How many loaves do you have?" Jesus asked. "Seven," they replied, "and a few small fish."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.35">He told the crowd to sit down on the ground.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.36">Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and when he had given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and they in turn to the people.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.37">They all ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.38">The number of those who ate was four thousand men, besides women and children.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.15.39">After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat and went to the vicinity of Magadan.</verse>

      <title type="main">The Demand for a Sign</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.16.1">The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from heaven.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.16.2">He replied, "When evening comes, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red,'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.16.3">and in the morning, 'Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.16.4">A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah." Jesus then left them and went away.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.16.5">When they went across the lake, the disciples forgot to take bread.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.16.6">"Be careful," Jesus said to them. "Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.16.7">They discussed this among themselves and said, "It is because we didn't bring any bread."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.16.8">Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked, "You of little faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.16.9">Do you still not understand? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.16.10">Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.16.11">How is it you don't understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.16.12">Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Peter Declares That Jesus Is the Messiah</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.16.13">When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.16.14">They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.16.15">"But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.16.16">Simon Peter answered, "You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.16.17">Jesus replied, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.16.18">And I tell you that you are Peter<note type="translation">The name "Peter" means "rock" or "stone"</note>, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.</verse>

      <title type="sub">Jesus Predicts His Death</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.16.21">From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.16.22">Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. "Never, Lord!" he said. "This shall never happen to you!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.16.23">Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.16.24">Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.16.25">For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.17.2">There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.17.3">Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.17.4">Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.17.5">While he was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.17.6">When the disciples heard this, they fell facedown to the ground, terrified.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.17.7">But Jesus came and touched them. "Get up," he said. "Don't be afraid."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.17.8">When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.17.9">As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them, "Don't tell anyone what you have seen, until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.17.10">The disciples asked him, "Why then do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.17.11">Jesus replied, "To be sure, Elijah comes and will restore all things.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.17.12">But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but have done to him everything they wished. In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands."</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.17.18">Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy, and he was healed at that moment.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.17.19">Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.17.20">He replied, "Because you have so little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.25.46">"Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but those who lived rightly to eternal life."</verse>

      <title type="main">The Plot Against Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.1">When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.2">"As you know, the Passover is two days away—and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.3">Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.4">and they schemed to arrest Jesus secretly and kill him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.5">"But not during the festival," they said, "or there may be a riot among the people."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Anointed at Bethany</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.6">While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of Simon the Leper,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.7">a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.8">When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. "Why this waste?" they asked.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.9">"This perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.10">Aware of this, Jesus said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.11">The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have me.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.12">When she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.13">Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Judas Agrees to Betray Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.14">Then one of the Twelve—the one called Judas Iscariot—went to the chief priests</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.15">and asked, "What are you willing to give me if I deliver him over to you?" So they counted out for him thirty pieces of silver.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.16">From then on Judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Last Supper</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.17">On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.18">He replied, "Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, 'The Teacher says: My appointed time is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.19">So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.20">When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.21">And while they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.22">They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other, "Surely you don't mean me, Lord?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.23">Jesus replied, "The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.24">The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But terrible sorrow awaits that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.25">Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said, "Surely you don't mean me, Rabbi?" Jesus answered, "You have said so."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.26">While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.27">Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.28">This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.29">I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.30">When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Predicts Peter's Denial</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.31">Then Jesus told them, "This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: "'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.32">But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.33">Peter replied, "Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.34">"Truly I tell you," Jesus answered, "this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.35">But Peter declared, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you." And all the other disciples said the same.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Gethsemane</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.36">Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.37">He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.38">Then he said to them, "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.39">Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.40">Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Couldn't you men keep watch with me for one hour?" he asked Peter.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.41">"Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.42">He went away a second time and prayed, "My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.43">When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.44">So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.45">Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.46">Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!"</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Arrested</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.47">While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.48">Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.49">Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.50">Jesus replied, "Do what you came for, friend." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus and arrested him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.51">With that, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.52">"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus said to him, "for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.53">Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.54">But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.55">In that hour Jesus said to the crowd, "Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.56">But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Before the Sanhedrin</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.57">Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.58">But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.59">The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.60">But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally two came forward</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.61">and declared, "This fellow said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.62">Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.63">But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.64">"You have said so," Jesus replied. "But I say to all of you: From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.65">Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken against God in an insulting way<note type="translation">The Greek word "blasphemeo" means to speak against God in an insulting way</note>! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the insulting words against God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.66">What do you think?" "He is worthy of death," they answered.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.67">Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.68">and said, "Prophesy to us, Messiah. Who hit you?"</verse>
      <title type="sub">Peter Denies Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.69">Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him. "You also were with Jesus of Galilee," she said.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.70">But he denied it before them all. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.71">Then he went out to the gateway, where another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, "This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.72">He denied it again, with an oath: "I don't know the man!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.73">After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, "Surely you are one of them; your accent gives you away."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.74">Then he began to call down curses, and he swore to them, "I don't know the man!" Immediately a rooster crowed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.26.75">Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: "Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.</verse>

      <title type="main">Judas Hangs Himself</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.1">Early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people made their plans to have Jesus executed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.2">So they bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate the governor.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.3">When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.4">"I have sinned," he said, "for I have betrayed innocent blood." "What is that to us?" they replied. "That's your responsibility."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.5">So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.6">The chief priests picked up the coins and said, "It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.7">So they decided to use the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.8">That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.9">Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the people of Israel,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.10">and they used them to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Before Pilate</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.11">Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" "You have said so," Jesus replied.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.12">When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.13">Then Pilate asked him, "Don't you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.14">But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge—to the great amazement of the governor.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.15">Now it was the governor's custom at the festival to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.16">At that time they had a well-known prisoner whose name was Jesus Barabbas.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.17">So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Which one do you want me to release to you: Jesus Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.18">For he knew it was out of self-interest that they had handed Jesus over to him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.19">While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him this message: "Don't have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.20">But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.21">"Which of the two do you want me to release to you?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.22">"What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called the Messiah?" Pilate asked. They all answered, "Crucify him!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.23">"Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.24">When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.25">All the people answered, "His blood is on us and on our children!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.26">Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Soldiers Mock Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.27">Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.28">They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.29">and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt in front of him and mocked him. "Hail, king of the Jews!" they said.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.30">They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.31">After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Crucifixion of Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.32">As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.33">They came to a place called Golgotha (which means "the place of the skull").</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.34">There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.35">When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.36">And sitting down, they kept watch over him there.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.37">Above his head they placed the written charge against him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.38">Two rebels were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.39">Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.40">and saying, "You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.41">In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.42">"He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself! He's the king of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.43">He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, 'I am the Son of God.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.44">In the same way the rebels who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Death of Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.45">From noon until 3 PM darkness came over all the land.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.46">About 3 PM Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" (which means "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?").</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.47">When some of those standing there heard this, they said, "He's calling Elijah."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.48">Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.49">The rest said, "Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.50">And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.51">At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, the rocks split</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.52">and the tombs broke open. The bodies of many people set apart for God<note type="translation">The Greek word "hagios" means set apart for God or holy</note> who had died were raised to life.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.53">They came out of the tombs after Jesus' resurrection and went into the city set apart for God<note type="translation">Jerusalem was called the holy city</note> and appeared to many people.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.54">When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, "Surely he was the Son of God!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.55">Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.56">Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Burial of Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.57">As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.58">Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.59">Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.60">and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.61">Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Guard at the Tomb</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.62">The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.63">"Sir," they said, "we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, 'After three days I will rise again.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.64">So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.65">"Take a guard," Pilate answered. "Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.27.66">So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.</verse>

      <title type="main">Jesus Has Risen</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.28.1">After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.28.2">There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.28.3">His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.28.4">The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.28.5">The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.28.6">He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.28.7">Then go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.28.8">So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.28.9">Suddenly Jesus met them. "Greetings," he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.28.10">Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Guards' Report</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.28.11">While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.</verse>
