      <title type="main">The Visit of the Wise Men</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.1">After Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, look, wise men<note type="translation">The Greek word "magoi" refers to astronomers or astrologers from the East</note> from the east came to Jerusalem,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.2">saying, "Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.3">When King Herod heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.4">And gathering all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ was to be born.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.5">They told him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is what has been written through the prophet:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.6">'And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.7">Then Herod secretly called the wise men and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.8">And sending them to Bethlehem, he said, "Go and search carefully for the child. When you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.9">After hearing the king, they went on their way, and look, the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.10">When they saw the star, they rejoiced with extremely great joy.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.11">And coming into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.12">And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another route.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Escape to Egypt</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.13">After they had left, look, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you. For Herod is about to search for the child to destroy him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.14">So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night, and departed to Egypt,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.15">and was there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet: "Out of Egypt I called my son."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Killing of the Children</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.16">Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had determined from the wise men.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.17">Then was fulfilled what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.18">"A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; and she refused to be comforted, because they are no more."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Return from Egypt</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.19">But when Herod died, look, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.20">saying, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child's life are dead."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.21">So he got up, took the child and his mother, and entered the land of Israel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.22">But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.23">And he went and lived in a city called Nazareth, so that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, that he would be called a Nazarene.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.3.3">For this is the one who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah, saying: "A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight paths for him.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.4">Now John wore clothing made from camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.5">Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region around the Jordan went out to him,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.6">and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.7">But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, "You offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.8">Therefore produce fruit worthy of a changed mind.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.9">And don't think to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.10">Even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that doesn't produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.11">I baptize you with water for a change of mind, but the one who is coming after me is more powerful than I am, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.12">His winnowing fork<note type="translation">A tool used to separate wheat from chaff</note> is in his hand, and he will thoroughly clean his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Baptism of Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.13">Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.3.15">But Jesus answered him, "Let it be so now, for it is proper for us to fulfill all that is right." Then he consented.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.16">When Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and look, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming on him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.17">And look, a voice from the heavens said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.4.3">And the tempter came and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.4">But he answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.5">Then the devil took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.6">and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, 'He will command his angels concerning you,' and 'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.7">Jesus said to him, "Again it is written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.8">Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.9">And he said to him, "All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.10">Then Jesus said to him, "Go away, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'"</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.4.15">"The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles—</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.16">the people dwelling in darkness have seen a great light, and for those dwelling in the region and shadow of death, on them a light has dawned."</verse>

      <title type="sub">Jesus Calls the First Disciples</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.18">While walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (who is called Peter) and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.19">And he said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.20">Immediately they left their nets and followed him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.21">And going on from there he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.5.12">Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Salt and Light</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.5.13">"You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.5.14">You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.5.15">Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl<note type="translation">The Greek word "modios" refers to a measuring basket or bowl</note>. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.5.19">Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.5.20">For I tell you that unless your way of doing what's right surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.6.1">"Be careful not to practice your acts of doing what's right in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.2">So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.3">But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.4">so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Prayer</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.5">"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.6">But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.7">And when you pray, do not keep on babbling<note type="translation">The Greek word "battalogeo" means to repeat words meaninglessly or to babble</note> like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.8">Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.9">"This, then, is how you should pray: 'Our Father in heaven, may your name be set apart as special<note type="translation">The Greek word "hagiazo" means to make holy or set apart</note>,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.10">your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.11">Give us today our daily bread<note type="translation">The Greek word "epiousios" likely refers to daily or necessary bread</note>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.12">And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.13">And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.14">For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.15">But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Fasting</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.16">"When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.17">But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.18">so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Treasures in Heaven</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.19">"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.20">But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.21">For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.22">"The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.23">But if your eyes are unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.24">"No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money<note type="translation">The Aramaic word "mammon" refers to material wealth or possessions</note>.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Do Not Worry</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.25">"Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.26">Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.27">Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life<note type="translation">The Greek phrase could refer to adding to one's lifespan or physical stature</note>?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.28">"And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.29">Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.30">If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.31">So do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.32">For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.33">But seek first his kingdom and his way of doing what's right, and all these things will be given to you as well.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.34">Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.</verse>

      <title type="sub">Judging Others</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.1">"Do not judge, or you too will be judged.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.2">For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.3">"Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.4">How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when all the time there is a plank in your own eye?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.5">You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.6">"Do not give dogs what is set apart for God<note type="translation">The Greek word "hagios" means holy or set apart</note>, and do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and then turn and tear you to pieces.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Ask, Seek, Knock</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.7">"Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.8">For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.9">"Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.10">Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.11">If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.12">So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Narrow and Wide Gates</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.13">"Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.14">But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.</verse>
      <title type="sub">True and False Prophets</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.15">"Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.16">By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.17">Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.18">A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.19">Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.20">Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.</verse>
      <title type="sub">True and False Disciples</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.21">"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.22">Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.23">Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Wise and Foolish Builders</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.24">"Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.25">The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.26">But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.27">The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.28">When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.7.29">because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.8.1">When Jesus came down from the mountainside, large crowds followed him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.2">A man with leprosy came and knelt before him and said, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.3">Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" Immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.4">Then Jesus said to him, "See that you don't tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Faith of the Centurion</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.5">When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.6">"Lord," he said, "my servant lies at home paralyzed, suffering terribly."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.7">Jesus said to him, "Shall I come and heal him?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.8">The centurion replied, "Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.9">For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.10">When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.11">I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.12">But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.13">Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go! Let it be done just as you believed it would." And his servant was healed at that moment.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Heals Many</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.14">When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.15">He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to wait on him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.16">When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.17">This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: "He took up our infirmities and bore our diseases."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Cost of Following Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.18">When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.19">Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.20">Jesus replied, "Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.21">Another disciple said to him, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.22">But Jesus told him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Calms the Storm</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.23">Then he got into the boat and his disciples followed him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.24">Suddenly a furious storm came up on the lake, so that the waves swept over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.25">The disciples went and woke him, saying, "Lord, save us! We're going to drown!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.26">He replied, "You of little faith, why are you so afraid?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.27">The men were amazed and asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!"</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Restores Two Demon-Possessed Men</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.28">When he arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him. They were so violent that no one could pass that way.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.29">"What do you want with us, Son of God?" they shouted. "Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.30">Some distance from them a large herd of pigs was feeding.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.31">The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.32">He said to them, "Go!" So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.33">Those tending the pigs ran off, went into the town and reported all this, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.8.34">Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they pleaded with him to leave their region.</verse>

      <title type="sub">Jesus Forgives and Heals a Paralyzed Man</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.1">Jesus stepped into a boat, crossed over and came to his own town.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.2">Some men brought to him a paralyzed man, lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.3">At this, some of the teachers of the law said to themselves, "This fellow is speaking words that insult God<note type="translation">The Greek word "blasphemeo" means to speak against the sacred or insult God</note>!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.4">Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.5">Which is easier: to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.6">But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." So he said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, take your mat and go home."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.7">Then the man got up and went home.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.8">When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe; and they praised God, who had given such authority to man.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Calling of Matthew</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.9">As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.10">While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.11">When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.12">On hearing this, Jesus said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.13">But go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' For I have not come to call those who are in right standing with God<note type="translation">The Greek word "dikaios" means righteous or in right standing</note>, but sinners."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Questioned About Fasting</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.14">Then John's disciples came and asked him, "How is it that we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.15">Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.16">"No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.17">Neither do people pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Raises a Dead Girl and Heals a Sick Woman</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.18">While he was saying this, a synagogue leader came and knelt before him and said, "My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.19">Jesus got up and went with him, and so did his disciples.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.20">Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.21">She said to herself, "If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.22">Jesus turned and saw her. "Take heart, daughter," he said, "your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed at that moment.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.23">When Jesus entered the synagogue leader's house and saw the pipe players and the noisy crowd,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.24">he said, "Go away. The girl is not dead but asleep." But they laughed at him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.25">After the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.26">News of this spread throughout that region.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Heals the Blind and the Mute</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.27">As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.28">When he had gone indoors, the blind men came to him, and he asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" "Yes, Lord," they replied.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.29">Then he touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith let it be done to you;"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.30">and their sight was restored. Jesus warned them sternly, "See that no one knows about this."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.31">But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.32">While they were going out, a man who was mute and demon-possessed was brought to Jesus.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.33">And when the demon was driven out, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowd was amazed and said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.34">But the Pharisees said, "It is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Workers Are Few</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.35">Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.36">When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.37">Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.9.38">Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field."</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.10.3">Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.10.4">Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.10.5">These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: "Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.10.6">Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.10.7">As you go, proclaim this message: 'The kingdom of heaven has come near.'</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.10.10">no bag for the journey or extra shirt or sandals or a staff, for the worker is worth his keep.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.10.11">Whatever town or village you enter, search there for some worthy person and stay at their house until you leave.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.10.12">As you enter the home, give it your greeting.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.10.14">If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.10.15">Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.10.16">"I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.10.17">Be on your guard; you will be handed over to the local councils and be flogged in the synagogues.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.10.18">On my account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.</verse>

      <title type="sub">Jesus and John the Baptist</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.11.1">After Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.11.2">When John, who was in prison, heard about the deeds of the Messiah, he sent his disciples</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.11.3">to ask him, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.11.4">Jesus replied, "Go back and report to John what you hear and see:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.11.5">The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.11.6">Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.11.7">As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.11.8">If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear fine clothes are in kings' palaces.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.11.9">Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.11.10">This is the one about whom it is written: 'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.11.11">Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.11.12">From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been subjected to violence, and violent people have been raiding it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.11.13">For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.11.14">And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.11.15">Whoever has ears, let them hear.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.11.16">"To what can I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to others:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.11.17">'We played the pipe for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.11.18">For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.11.19">The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' But wisdom is proved right by her deeds."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Judgment on Unrepentant Towns</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.11.20">Then Jesus began to denounce the towns in which most of his miracles had been performed, because they did not change their minds<note type="translation">The Greek word "metanoeo" means to change one's mind or thinking</note>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.11.21">"What sorrow awaits you, Chorazin! What sorrow awaits you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have changed their minds long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.11.22">But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.11.23">And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades. For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day.</verse>

      <title type="sub">The Father Revealed in the Son</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.11.25">At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.11.26">Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.11.27">"All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.</verse>

      <title type="sub">Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.1">At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.2">When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.3">He answered, "Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.4">He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread—which was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.5">Or haven't you read in the Law that the priests on Sabbath duty in the temple desecrate the Sabbath and yet are innocent?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.6">I tell you that something greater than the temple is here.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.7">If you had known what these words mean, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the innocent.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.8">For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.9">Going on from that place, he went into their synagogue,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.10">and a man with a shriveled hand was there. Looking for a reason to bring charges against Jesus, they asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.11">He said to them, "If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.12">How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.13">Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.14">But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.</verse>
      <title type="sub">God's Chosen Servant</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.15">Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. A large crowd followed him, and he healed all who were ill.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.16">He warned them not to tell others about him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.17">This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.18">"Here is my servant whom I have chosen, the one I love, in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.19">He will not quarrel or cry out; no one will hear his voice in the streets.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.20">A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out, till he has brought justice through to victory.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.21">In his name the nations will put their hope."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus and Beelzebul</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.22">Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he could both talk and see.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.23">All the people were astonished and said, "Could this be the Son of David?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.24">But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, "It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.25">Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.26">If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.27">And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.28">But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.29">"Or again, how can anyone enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.30">"Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.31">And so I tell you, every kind of sin and slander can be forgiven, but speaking against the Spirit that insults God<note type="translation">The Greek phrase means "blasphemy against the Spirit" - insulting God's Spirit</note> will not be forgiven.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.32">Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.33">"Make a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is recognized by its fruit.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.34">You brood of vipers, how can you who are evil say anything good? For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.35">A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.36">But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.37">For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Sign of Jonah</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.38">Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.39">He answered, "A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.40">For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.41">The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they changed their minds<note type="translation">The Greek word "metanoeo" means to change one's mind or thinking</note> at the preaching of Jonah, and now something greater than Jonah is here.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.42">The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and now something greater than Solomon is here.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.43">"When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.44">Then it says, 'I will return to the house I left.' When it arrives, it finds the house unoccupied, swept clean and put in order.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.45">Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first. That is how it will be with this wicked generation."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus' Mother and Brothers</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.46">While Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.47">Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.48">He replied to him, "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.12.49">Pointing to his disciples, he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers.</verse>
