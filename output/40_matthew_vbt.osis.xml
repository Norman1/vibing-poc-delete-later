      <title type="main">The Visit of the Wise Men</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.1">After Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, look, wise men<note type="translation">The Greek word "magoi" refers to astronomers or astrologers from the East</note> from the east came to Jerusalem,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.2">saying, "Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.3">When King Herod heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.4">And gathering all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ was to be born.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.5">They told him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is what has been written through the prophet:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.6">'And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.7">Then Herod secretly called the wise men and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.8">And sending them to Bethlehem, he said, "Go and search carefully for the child. When you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.9">After hearing the king, they went on their way, and look, the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.10">When they saw the star, they rejoiced with extremely great joy.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.11">And coming into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.12">And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another route.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Escape to Egypt</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.13">After they had left, look, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you. For Herod is about to search for the child to destroy him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.14">So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night, and departed to Egypt,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.15">and was there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet: "Out of Egypt I called my son."</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.2.18">"A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; and she refused to be comforted, because they are no more."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Return from Egypt</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.19">But when Herod died, look, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.20">saying, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child's life are dead."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.21">So he got up, took the child and his mother, and entered the land of Israel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.22">But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.23">And he went and lived in a city called Nazareth, so that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, that he would be called a Nazarene.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.3.4">Now John wore clothing made from camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.5">Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region around the Jordan went out to him,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.6">and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.7">But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, "You offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.8">Therefore produce fruit worthy of a changed mind.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.9">And don't think to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.10">Even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that doesn't produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.11">I baptize you with water for a change of mind, but the one who is coming after me is more powerful than I am, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.12">His winnowing fork<note type="translation">A tool used to separate wheat from chaff</note> is in his hand, and he will thoroughly clean his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire."</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.3.15">But Jesus answered him, "Let it be so now, for it is proper for us to fulfill all that is right." Then he consented.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.16">When Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and look, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming on him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.17">And look, a voice from the heavens said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.4.4">But he answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.5">Then the devil took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.6">and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, 'He will command his angels concerning you,' and 'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.7">Jesus said to him, "Again it is written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.8">Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.9">And he said to him, "All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.10">Then Jesus said to him, "Go away, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'"</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.4.15">"The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles—</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.16">the people dwelling in darkness have seen a great light, and for those dwelling in the region and shadow of death, on them a light has dawned."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.17">From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Change your minds, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Calls the First Disciples</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.18">While walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (who is called Peter) and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.19">And he said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.20">Immediately they left their nets and followed him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.21">And going on from there he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them.</verse>
