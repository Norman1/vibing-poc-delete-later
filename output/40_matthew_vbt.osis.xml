      <title type="main">The Visit of the Wise Men</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.1">After Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, look, wise men<note type="translation">The Greek word "magoi" refers to astronomers or astrologers from the East</note> from the east came to Jerusalem,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.2">saying, "Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.3">When King Herod heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.4">And gathering all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ was to be born.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.5">They told him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is what has been written through the prophet:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.6">'And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.7">Then Herod secretly called the wise men and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.8">And sending them to Bethlehem, he said, "Go and search carefully for the child. When you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.9">After hearing the king, they went on their way, and look, the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.10">When they saw the star, they rejoiced with extremely great joy.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.11">And coming into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.12">And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another route.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Escape to Egypt</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.13">After they had left, look, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you. For Herod is about to search for the child to destroy him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.14">So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night, and departed to Egypt,</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.2.18">"A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; and she refused to be comforted, because they are no more."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Return from Egypt</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.19">But when Herod died, look, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.20">saying, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child's life are dead."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.21">So he got up, took the child and his mother, and entered the land of Israel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.22">But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.23">And he went and lived in a city called Nazareth, so that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, that he would be called a Nazarene.</verse>
