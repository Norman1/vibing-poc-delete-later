      <title type="main">The Visit of the Wise Men</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.1">After Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, look, wise men<note type="translation">The Greek word "magoi" refers to astronomers or astrologers from the East</note> from the east came to Jerusalem,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.2">saying, "Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.3">When King Herod heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.4">And gathering all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ was to be born.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.5">They told him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is what has been written through the prophet:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.6">'And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.7">Then Herod secretly called the wise men and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.8">And sending them to Bethlehem, he said, "Go and search carefully for the child. When you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.9">After hearing the king, they went on their way, and look, the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.10">When they saw the star, they rejoiced with extremely great joy.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.11">And coming into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.12">And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another route.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Escape to Egypt</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.13">After they had left, look, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you. For Herod is about to search for the child to destroy him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.14">So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night, and departed to Egypt,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.15">and was there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet: "Out of Egypt I called my son."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Killing of the Children</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.16">Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had determined from the wise men.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.17">Then was fulfilled what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.18">"A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; and she refused to be comforted, because they are no more."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Return from Egypt</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.19">But when Herod died, look, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.20">saying, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child's life are dead."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.21">So he got up, took the child and his mother, and entered the land of Israel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.22">But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.2.23">And he went and lived in a city called Nazareth, so that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, that he would be called a Nazarene.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.3.3">For this is the one who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah, saying: "A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight paths for him.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.4">Now John wore clothing made from camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.5">Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region around the Jordan went out to him,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.6">and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.7">But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, "You offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.8">Therefore produce fruit worthy of a changed mind.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.9">And don't think to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.10">Even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that doesn't produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.11">I baptize you with water for a change of mind, but the one who is coming after me is more powerful than I am, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.12">His winnowing fork<note type="translation">A tool used to separate wheat from chaff</note> is in his hand, and he will thoroughly clean his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Baptism of Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.13">Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.3.15">But Jesus answered him, "Let it be so now, for it is proper for us to fulfill all that is right." Then he consented.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.16">When Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and look, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming on him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.3.17">And look, a voice from the heavens said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.4.3">And the tempter came and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.4">But he answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.5">Then the devil took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.6">and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, 'He will command his angels concerning you,' and 'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.7">Jesus said to him, "Again it is written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.8">Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.9">And he said to him, "All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.10">Then Jesus said to him, "Go away, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'"</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.4.15">"The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles—</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.16">the people dwelling in darkness have seen a great light, and for those dwelling in the region and shadow of death, on them a light has dawned."</verse>

      <title type="sub">Jesus Calls the First Disciples</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.18">While walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (who is called Peter) and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.19">And he said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.20">Immediately they left their nets and followed him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.4.21">And going on from there he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.5.12">Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Salt and Light</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.5.13">"You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.5.14">You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.5.15">Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl<note type="translation">The Greek word "modios" refers to a measuring basket or bowl</note>. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.5.19">Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.5.20">For I tell you that unless your way of doing what's right surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Matt.6.1">"Be careful not to practice your acts of doing what's right in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.2">So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.3">But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.4">so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Prayer</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.5">"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.6">But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.7">And when you pray, do not keep on babbling<note type="translation">The Greek word "battalogeo" means to repeat words meaninglessly or to babble</note> like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.8">Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.9">"This, then, is how you should pray: 'Our Father in heaven, may your name be set apart as special<note type="translation">The Greek word "hagiazo" means to make holy or set apart</note>,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.10">your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.11">Give us today our daily bread<note type="translation">The Greek word "epiousios" likely refers to daily or necessary bread</note>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.12">And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.13">And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.14">For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.15">But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Fasting</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.16">"When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.17">But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.18">so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Treasures in Heaven</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.19">"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.20">But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.21">For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.22">"The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.23">But if your eyes are unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.24">"No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money<note type="translation">The Aramaic word "mammon" refers to material wealth or possessions</note>.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Do Not Worry</title>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.25">"Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.26">Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.27">Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life<note type="translation">The Greek phrase could refer to adding to one's lifespan or physical stature</note>?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.28">"And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.29">Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.30">If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.31">So do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.32">For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.33">But seek first his kingdom and his way of doing what's right, and all these things will be given to you as well.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Matt.6.34">Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.</verse>
