        <chapter osisID="Deut.1" sID="Deut.1"/>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.1">These are the words Moses spoke to all Israel in the wilderness east of the Jordan—that is, in the Arabah—opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth and Dizahab.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.2">(It takes eleven days to go from Horeb to Kadesh Barnea by the Mount Seir road.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.3">In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses proclaimed to the Israelites all that Yahweh had commanded him concerning them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.4">This was after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, and at Edrei had defeated Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.5">East of the Jordan in the territory of Moab, Moses began to expound this law, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.6">Yahweh our God said to us at Horeb, "You have stayed long enough at this mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.7">Break camp and advance into the hill country of the Amorites; go to all the neighboring peoples in the Arabah, in the mountains, in the western foothills, in the Negev and along the coast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.8">See, I have given you this land. Go in and take possession of the land Yahweh swore he would give to your fathers—to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob—and to their descendants after them."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.9">At that time I said to you, "You are too heavy a burden for me to carry alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.10">Yahweh your God has increased your numbers so that today you are as numerous as the stars in the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.11">May Yahweh, the God of your ancestors, increase you a thousand times and bless you as he has promised!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.12">But how can I bear your problems and your burdens and your disputes all by myself?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.13">Choose some wise, understanding and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will set them over you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.14">You answered me, "What you propose to do is good."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.15">So I took the leading men of your tribes, wise and respected men, and appointed them to have authority over you—as commanders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens and as tribal officials.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.16">And I charged your judges at that time, "Hear the disputes between your people and judge fairly, whether the case is between two Israelites or between an Israelite and a foreigner residing among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.17">Do not show partiality in judging; hear both small and great alike. Do not be afraid of anyone, for judgment belongs to God. Bring me any case too hard for you, and I will hear it."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.18">And at that time I told you everything you were to do.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">The Spies Sent Out</title>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.19">Then, as Yahweh our God commanded us, we set out from Horeb and went toward the hill country of the Amorites through all that vast and dreadful wilderness that you have seen, and so we reached Kadesh Barnea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.20">Then I said to you, "You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which Yahweh our God is giving us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.21">See, Yahweh your God has given you the land. Go up and take possession of it as Yahweh, the God of your ancestors, told you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.22">Then all of you came to me and said, "Let us send men ahead to spy out the land for us and bring back a report about the route we are to take and the towns we will come to."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.23">The idea seemed good to me; so I selected twelve of you, one man from each tribe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.24">They left and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshkol and explored it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.25">Taking with them some of the fruit of the land, they brought it down to us and reported, "It is a good land that Yahweh our God is giving us."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.26">But you were unwilling to go up; you rebelled against the command of Yahweh your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.27">You grumbled in your tents and said, "Yahweh hates us; so he brought us out of Egypt to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.28">Where can we go? Our brothers have made our hearts melt in fear. They say, 'The people are stronger and taller than we are; the cities are large, with walls up to the sky. We even saw the Anakites there.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.29">Then I said to you, "Do not be terrified; do not be afraid of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.30">Yahweh your God, who is going before you, will fight for you, as he did for you in Egypt, before your very eyes,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.31">and in the wilderness. There you saw how Yahweh your God carried you, as a father carries his son, all the way you went until you reached this place."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.32">In spite of this, you did not trust in Yahweh your God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.33">who went ahead of you on your journey, in fire by night and in a cloud by day, to search out places for you to camp and to show you the way you should go.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.34">When Yahweh heard what you said, he was angry and solemnly swore:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.35">"No one from this evil generation shall see the good land I swore to give your ancestors,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.36">except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land he set his feet on, because he followed Yahweh wholeheartedly."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.37">Because of you Yahweh became angry with me also and said, "You shall not enter it, either.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.38">But your assistant, Joshua son of Nun, will enter it. Encourage him, because he will lead Israel to inherit it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.39">And the little ones that you said would be taken captive, your children who do not yet know good from bad—they will enter the land. I will give it to them and they will take possession of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.40">But as for you, turn around and set out toward the wilderness along the route to the Red Sea."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.41">Then you replied, "We have wronged against Yahweh. We will go up and fight, as Yahweh our God commanded us." So every one of you put on his weapons, thinking it easy to go up into the hill country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.42">But Yahweh said to me, "Tell them, 'Do not go up and fight, because I will not be with you. You will be defeated by your enemies.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.43">So I told you, but you would not listen. You rebelled against Yahweh's command and in your arrogance you marched up into the hill country.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.44">The Amorites who lived in those hills came out against you; they chased you like a swarm of bees and beat you down from Seir all the way to Hormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.45">You came back and wept before Yahweh, but he paid no attention to your weeping and turned a deaf ear to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.1.46">And so you stayed in Kadesh many days—all the time you spent there.</verse>
        <chapter eID="Deut.1"/>

        <title type="sub">Wanderings in the Wilderness</title>
        <chapter osisID="Deut.2" sID="Deut.2"/>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.1">Then we turned back and set out toward the wilderness along the route to the Red Sea, as Yahweh had directed me. For a long time we made our way around the hill country of Seir.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.2">Then Yahweh said to me,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.3">"You have made your way around this hill country long enough; now turn north.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.4">Give the people these orders: 'You are about to pass through the territory of your relatives the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, but be very careful.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.5">Do not provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land, not even enough to put your foot on. I have given Esau the hill country of Seir as his own.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.6">You are to pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you drink.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.7">Yahweh your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has watched over your journey through this vast wilderness. These forty years Yahweh your God has been with you, and you have not lacked anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.8">So we went on past our relatives the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. We turned from the Arabah road, which comes up from Elath and Ezion Geber, and traveled along the desert road of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.9">Then Yahweh said to me, "Do not harass the Moabites or provoke them to war, for I will not give you any part of their land. I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as a possession."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.10">(The Emites used to live there—a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.11">Like the Anakites, they too were considered Rephaites, but the Moabites called them Emites.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.12">Horites used to live in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out. They destroyed the Horites from before them and settled in their place, just as Israel did in the land Yahweh gave them as their possession.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.13">And Yahweh said, "Now get up and cross the Zered Valley." So we crossed the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.14">Thirty-eight years passed from the time we left Kadesh Barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley. By then, that entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp, as Yahweh had sworn to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.15">Yahweh's hand was against them until he had completely eliminated them from the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.16">Now when the last of these fighting men among the people had died,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.17">Yahweh said to me,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.18">"Today you are to pass by the region of Moab at Ar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.19">When you come to the Ammonites, do not harass them or provoke them to war, for I will not give you possession of any land belonging to the Ammonites. I have given it as a possession to the descendants of Lot."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.20">(That too was considered a land of the Rephaites, who used to live there; but the Ammonites called them Zamzummites.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.21">They were a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites. But Yahweh destroyed them from before the Ammonites, who drove them out and settled in their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.22">Yahweh had done the same for the descendants of Esau, who lived in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them. They drove them out and have lived in their place to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.23">And as for the Avvites who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorites coming out from Caphtor destroyed them and settled in their place.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.24">"Set out now and cross the Arnon Gorge. See, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his country. Begin to take possession of it and engage him in battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.25">This very day I will begin to put the terror and fear of you on all the nations under heaven. They will hear reports of you and will tremble and be in anguish because of you."</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">Defeat of Sihon King of Heshbon</title>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.26">From the wilderness of Kedemoth I sent messengers to Sihon king of Heshbon offering peace and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.27">"Let us pass through your country. We will stay on the main road; we will not turn aside to the right or to the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.28">Sell us food to eat and water to drink for their price in silver. Only let us pass through on foot—</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.29">as the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, and the Moabites, who live in Ar, did for us—until we cross the Jordan into the land Yahweh our God is giving us."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.30">But Sihon king of Heshbon refused to let us pass through. For Yahweh your God had made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate in order to give him into your hands, as he has now done.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.31">Yahweh said to me, "See, I have begun to deliver Sihon and his country over to you. Now begin to conquer and possess his land."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.32">When Sihon and all his army came out to meet us in battle at Jahaz,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.33">Yahweh our God delivered him over to us and we struck him down, together with his sons and his whole army.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.34">At that time we took all his towns and completely destroyed them—men, women and children. We left no survivors.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.35">But the livestock and the plunder from the towns we had captured we carried off for ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.36">From Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the gorge, even as far as Gilead, not one town was too strong for us. Yahweh our God gave us all of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.2.37">But in accordance with the command of Yahweh our God, you did not encroach on any of the land of the Ammonites, neither the land along the course of the Jabbok nor that around the towns in the hills.</verse>
        <chapter eID="Deut.2"/>

        <title type="sub">Defeat of Og King of Bashan</title>
        <chapter osisID="Deut.3" sID="Deut.3"/>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.1">Next we turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan with his whole army marched out to meet us in battle at Edrei.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.2">Yahweh said to me, "Do not be afraid of him, for I have delivered him into your hands, along with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.3">So Yahweh our God also gave into our hands Og king of Bashan and all his army. We struck them down, leaving no survivors.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.4">At that time we took all his cities. There was not one of the sixty cities that we did not take from them—the whole region of Argob, Og's kingdom in Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.5">All these cities were fortified with high walls and with gates and bars, and there were also a great many unwalled villages.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.6">We completely destroyed them, as we had done with Sihon king of Heshbon, destroying every city—men, women and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.7">But all the livestock and the plunder from their cities we carried off for ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.8">So at that time we took from these two kings of the Amorites the territory east of the Jordan, from the Arnon Gorge as far as Mount Hermon.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.9">(Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians; the Amorites call it Senir.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.10">We took all the towns on the plateau, and all Gilead, and all Bashan as far as Salekah and Edrei, towns of Og's kingdom in Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.11">(Og king of Bashan was the last of the Rephaites. His bed was decorated with iron and was more than nine cubits long and four cubits wide. It is still in Rabbah of the Ammonites.)</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">Division of the Land</title>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.12">Of the land that we took over at that time, I gave the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory north of Aroer by the Arnon Gorge, including half the hill country of Gilead, together with its towns.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.13">The rest of Gilead and also all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (The whole region of Argob in Bashan used to be known as a land of the Rephaites.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.14">Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maakathites; it was named after him, so that to this day Bashan is called Havvoth Jair.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.15">And I gave Gilead to Makir.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.16">But to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory extending from Gilead down to the Arnon Gorge (the middle of the gorge being the border) and out to the Jabbok River, which is the border of the Ammonites.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.17">Its western border was the Jordan in the Arabah, from Kinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (that is, the Dead Sea), below the slopes of Pisgah.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.18">I commanded you at that time: "Yahweh your God has given you this land to take possession of it. But all your able-bodied men, armed for battle, must cross over ahead of the other Israelites.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.19">However, your wives, your children and your livestock (I know you have much livestock) may stay in the towns I have given you,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.20">until Yahweh gives rest to your fellow Israelites as he has to you, and they too have taken over the land that Yahweh your God is giving them across the Jordan. After that, each of you may go back to the possession I have given you."</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">Moses Forbidden to Cross the Jordan</title>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.21">At that time I commanded Joshua: "You have seen with your own eyes all that Yahweh your God has done to these two kings. Yahweh will do the same to all the kingdoms over there where you are going.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.22">Do not be afraid of them; Yahweh your God himself will fight for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.23">At that time I pleaded with Yahweh:</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.24">"Sovereign Yahweh, you have begun to show to your servant your greatness and your strong hand. For what god in heaven or on earth can do the deeds and mighty works you do?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.25">Let me go over and see the good land beyond the Jordan—that fine hill country and Lebanon."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.26">But because of you Yahweh was angry with me and would not listen to me. "That is enough," Yahweh said. "Do not speak to me anymore about this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.27">Go up to the top of Pisgah and look west and north and south and east. Look at the land with your eyes, since you are not going to cross this Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.28">But commission Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he will lead this people across and will cause them to inherit the land that you will see."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.3.29">So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor.</verse>
        <chapter eID="Deut.3"/>

        <title type="main">Obedience Commanded</title>
        <chapter osisID="Deut.4" sID="Deut.4"/>
        <verse osisID="Deut.4.1">Now, Israel, hear the decrees and laws I am about to teach you. Follow them so that you may live and may go in and take possession of the land Yahweh, the God of your ancestors, is giving you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.4.2">Do not add to what I command you and do not subtract from it, but keep the commands of Yahweh your God that I give you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.4.3">You saw with your own eyes what Yahweh did at Baal Peor. Yahweh your God destroyed from among you everyone who followed the Baal of Peor,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.4.4">but all of you who held fast to Yahweh your God are still alive today.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.4.5">See, I have taught you decrees and laws as Yahweh my God commanded me, so that you may follow them in the land you are entering to take possession of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.4.6">Observe them carefully, for this will show your wisdom and understanding to the nations, who will hear about all these decrees and say, "Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.4.7">What other nation is so great as to have their gods near them the way Yahweh our God is near us whenever we pray to him?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.4.8">And what other nation is so great as to have such righteous decrees and laws as this body of laws I am setting before you today?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.4.9">Only be careful, and watch yourselves closely so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen or let them fade from your heart as long as you live. Teach them to your children and to their children after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.4.10">Remember the day you stood before Yahweh your God at Horeb, when he said to me, "Assemble the people before me to hear my words so that they may learn to revere me as long as they live in the land and may teach their children to do the same."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.4.11">You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain while it blazed with fire to the very heavens, with black clouds and deep darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.4.12">Then Yahweh spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words but saw no form; there was only a voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.4.13">He declared to you his covenant, the Ten Commandments, which he commanded you to follow and then wrote them on two stone tablets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.4.14">And Yahweh directed me at that time to teach you the decrees and laws you are to follow in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.4.15">You saw no form of any kind the day Yahweh spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire. Therefore watch yourselves very carefully,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.4.16">so that you do not become corrupt and make for yourselves an idol, an image of any shape, whether formed like a man or a woman,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.4.17">or like any animal on earth or any bird that flies in the air,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.4.18">or like any creature that moves along the ground or any fish in the waters below.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Deut.9.7">Remember this and never forget how you aroused the anger of Yahweh your God in the wilderness. From the day you left Egypt until you arrived here, you have been rebellious against Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.9.8">At Horeb you aroused Yahweh's wrath so that he was angry enough to destroy you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.9.9">When I went up on the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that Yahweh had made with you, I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.9.10">Yahweh gave me two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God. On them were all the commandments Yahweh proclaimed to you on the mountain out of the fire, on the day of the assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.9.11">At the end of the forty days and forty nights, Yahweh gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.9.12">Then Yahweh told me, 'Go down from here at once, because your people whom you brought out of Egypt have become corrupt. They have turned away quickly from what I commanded them and have made an idol for themselves.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.9.13">And Yahweh said to me, 'I have seen this people, and they are a stiff-necked people indeed!</verse>

        <verse osisID="Deut.9.15">So I turned and went down from the mountain while it was ablaze with fire. And the two tablets of the covenant were in my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.9.16">When I looked, I saw that you had wronged against Yahweh your God; you had made for yourselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. You had turned aside quickly from the way that Yahweh had commanded you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.9.17">So I took the two tablets and threw them out of my hands, breaking them to pieces before your eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.9.18">Then once again I fell prostrate before Yahweh for forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water, because of all the wrongdoing you had committed, doing what was evil in Yahweh's sight and so arousing his anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.9.19">I feared the anger and wrath of Yahweh, for he was angry enough with you to destroy you. But again Yahweh listened to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.9.20">And Yahweh was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him, but at that time I prayed for Aaron too.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.9.21">Also I took that sinful thing of yours, the calf you had made, and burned it in the fire. Then I crushed it and ground it to powder as fine as dust and threw the dust into a stream that flowed down the mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.9.22">You also made Yahweh angry at Taberah, at Massah and at Kibroth Hattaavah.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.9.23">And when Yahweh sent you out from Kadesh Barnea, he said, 'Go up and take possession of the land I have given you.' But you rebelled against the command of Yahweh your God. You did not trust him or obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.9.24">You have been rebellious against Yahweh ever since I have known you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.9.25">I lay prostrate before Yahweh those forty days and forty nights because Yahweh had said he would destroy you.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.9.26">I prayed to Yahweh and said, 'Sovereign Yahweh, do not destroy your people, your own inheritance that you redeemed by your great power and brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Deut.9.27">Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Overlook the stubbornness of this people, their wickedness and their wrongdoing.</verse>
