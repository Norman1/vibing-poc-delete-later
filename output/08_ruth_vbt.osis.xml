        <title>Naomi Loses Her Family</title>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.1">
          Back when the judges ruled Israel, there was a famine in the land. A man from Bethlehem in Judah left with his wife and two sons to live temporarily in the country of Moab.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.2">
          <note type="study" n="2">Hebrew names: Elimelech means "My God is King"; Naomi means "Pleasant"; Mahlon means "Sickness"; Chilion means "Wasting."</note>
          The man's name was Elimelech, his wife was Naomi, and his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion—they were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. They went to Moab and settled there.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.3">
          Then Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died, leaving her with just her two sons.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.4">
          The sons married Moabite women—one named Orpah and the other Ruth. They lived there about ten years,
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.5">
          and then both Mahlon and Chilion died too. Naomi was left completely alone, without her sons or her husband.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.6">
          <note type="study" n="4">The Hebrew פָּקַד (paqad) means "to visit" or "to attend to."</note>
          When Naomi heard in Moab that Yahweh had come to help his people by providing food for them, she and her daughters-in-law prepared to return home from there.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.7">
          She left the place where she had been living, with both daughters-in-law accompanying her, and they started walking back to the land of Judah.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.8">
          <note type="study" n="5">The Hebrew חֶסֶד (hesed) means covenant loyalty or steadfast love.</note>
          But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, "Go back home, each of you to your mother's house. May Yahweh show you the same loyalty you've shown to your dead husbands and to me.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.9">
          May Yahweh help each of you find security in the home of a new husband." Then she kissed them goodbye, and they all broke down crying.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.10">
          "No," they said to her, "we're going back with you to your people."
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.11">
          But Naomi replied, "Go back home, my daughters. Why come with me? Do you think I could have more sons who could become your husbands?
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.12">
          <note type="study" n="6">Levirate marriage: a brother-in-law marries his dead brother's widow.</note>
          Go back home, my daughters. I'm too old to remarry. Even if I thought there was still hope—even if I got married tonight and then gave birth to sons—
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.13">
          would you wait for them to grow up? Would you stay single for them? No, my daughters. My situation is far more bitter than yours, because Yahweh has turned against me!"
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.14">
          They cried together again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth held on tight to her.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.15">
          "Look," said Naomi, "your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her."
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.16">
          But Ruth replied, "Don't pressure me to leave you or turn back from following you. Wherever you go, I'll go. Wherever you stay, I'll stay. Your people will be my people, and your God will be my God.
        </verse>

        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.18">
          When Naomi realized Ruth was absolutely determined to go with her, she stopped arguing.

          <note type="study" n="9">Hebrew: Bethlehem means "House of Bread."</note>
          So the two of them continued on until they reached Bethlehem. When they arrived, the whole town was stirred up about them. The women exclaimed, "Can this really be Naomi?"

        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.20">
          <note type="study" n="10">Hebrew: Mara means "Bitter," Naomi means "Pleasant."</note>
          "Don't call me Naomi," she told them. "Call me Mara, because the Almighty has made my life very bitter.

        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.22">
          So Naomi returned from Moab with Ruth the Moabite, her daughter-in-law. They arrived in Bethlehem just as the barley harvest was beginning.

          Now Naomi had a relative on her husband's side, a prominent and wealthy man from Elimelech's clan, whose name was Boaz.

          <note type="study" n="14">Gleaning: gathering leftover grain after harvest.</note>
          Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, "Let me go to the fields and pick up leftover grain behind anyone who shows me kindness." Naomi replied, "Go ahead, my daughter."
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.3">
          So she went out, entered a field, and began gleaning behind the harvesters. As it turned out, she found herself working in a field belonging to Boaz, who was from Elimelech's clan.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.4">
          Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters, "May Yahweh be with you!" "May Yahweh bless you!" they replied.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.5">
          Boaz asked the foreman of his harvesters, "Who does that young woman belong to?"
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.6">
          The foreman replied, "She's the young Moabite woman who came back with Naomi from Moab.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.7">
          She said, 'Please let me glean and gather among the bundles behind the harvesters.' She came and has been working steadily from morning till now, except for a short rest in the shelter."

        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.8">
          <note type="study" n="17">"My daughter" was a respectful form of address.</note>
          So Boaz said to Ruth, "Listen carefully, my daughter. Don't go gleaning in another field and don't leave this one. Stay here close to my female workers.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.9">
          Watch which field they're harvesting and follow along after them. I've ordered the men not to bother you. And whenever you're thirsty, go get a drink from the water jars the men have filled."

        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.11">
          Boaz replied, "I've been told all about what you've done for your mother-in-law since your husband died—how you left your father and mother and your homeland to come live with people you didn't know before.

        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.13">
          "May I continue to find favor in your eyes, my lord," she said. "You've comforted me and spoken kindly to your servant—though I don't even have the status of one of your female servants."

          <note type="study" n="20">Wine vinegar was a common condiment.</note>
          At mealtime Boaz said to her, "Come over here. Have some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar." When she sat down with the harvesters, he offered her roasted grain. She ate all she wanted and had some left over.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.15">
          As she got up to glean, Boaz gave orders to his men: "Let her gather among the bundles themselves and don't embarrass her.

          In fact, pull out some stalks from the bundles for her and leave them for her to pick up. And don't scold her!"

          <note type="study" n="22">An ephah was about 22 liters or 5 gallons.</note>
          So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening. When she threshed what she had gathered, it amounted to about an ephah of barley.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.18">
          She carried it back to town, and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered. Ruth also brought out and gave her what she had left over after eating her fill.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.19">
          Her mother-in-law asked her, "Where did you glean today? Where did you work? May whoever noticed you be blessed!" Then Ruth told her mother-in-law about the one at whose place she had been working. "The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz," she said.

        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.21">
          Ruth the Moabite said, "He even told me, 'Stay with my workers until they finish harvesting all my grain.'"
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.22">
          Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, "It's good, my daughter, that you go out with his female workers, so that people don't harass you in someone else's field."

          <note type="study" n="24">Barley and wheat harvests together lasted about seven weeks.</note>
          So Ruth stayed close to Boaz's female workers, gleaning until the barley and wheat harvests were finished. And she lived with her mother-in-law.
