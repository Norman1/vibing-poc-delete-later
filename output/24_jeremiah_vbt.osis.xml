          <title type="main">The Fall of Jerusalem</title>
          
          <verse osisID="Jer.52.1">Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</verse>
          
          <verse osisID="Jer.52.2">And he did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.</verse>
          
          <verse osisID="Jer.52.3">For because of the anger of Yahweh it came to the point in Jerusalem and Judah that he cast them out from his presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</verse>
          
          <verse osisID="Jer.52.4">And in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came with all his army against Jerusalem, and laid siege to it. And they built siegeworks all around it.</verse>
          
          <verse osisID="Jer.52.5">So the city was besieged till the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.</verse>
          
          <verse osisID="Jer.52.6">On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.</verse>
          
          <verse osisID="Jer.52.7">Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled and went out from the city by night by the way of a gate between the two walls, by the king's garden, and the Chaldeans were around the city. And they went in the direction of the Arabah.</verse>
          
          <verse osisID="Jer.52.8">But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was scattered from him.</verse>
          
          <verse osisID="Jer.52.9">Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him.</verse>
          
          <verse osisID="Jer.52.10">The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and also slaughtered all the officials of Judah at Riblah.</verse>
          
          <verse osisID="Jer.52.11">He put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in chains, and the king of Babylon took him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.</verse>
          
          <verse osisID="Jer.52.12">In the fifth month, on the tenth day of the monthâ€”that was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylonâ€”Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard, who served the king of Babylon, entered Jerusalem.</verse>
          
          <verse osisID="Jer.52.13">And he burned the house of Yahweh, and the king's house and all the houses of Jerusalem; every great house he burned down.</verse>
          
          <verse osisID="Jer.52.14">And all the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls around Jerusalem.</verse>
          
          <verse osisID="Jer.52.15">And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive some of the poorest of the people and the rest of the people who were left in the city and the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon, together with the rest of the artisans.</verse>
          
          <verse osisID="Jer.52.16">But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen.</verse>
          
          <verse osisID="Jer.52.28">This is the number of the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year, 3,023 Judeans;</verse>
          
          <verse osisID="Jer.52.29">in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem 832 persons;</verse>
          
          <verse osisID="Jer.52.30">in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Judeans 745 persons; all the persons were 4,600.</verse>
          
          <verse osisID="Jer.52.31">And in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, graciously freed Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison.</verse>
          
          <verse osisID="Jer.52.32">And he spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat above the seats of the kings who were with him in Babylon.</verse>
          
          <verse osisID="Jer.52.33">So Jehoiachin put off his prison garments. And every day of his life he dined regularly at the king's table,</verse>
          
          <verse osisID="Jer.52.34">and for his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king, according to his daily needs, until the day of his death, all the days of his life.</verse>
