      <div type="introduction">
        <p>James, the brother of Jesus and leader of the Jerusalem church, wrote this practical letter emphasizing that genuine faith must be demonstrated through good works and righteous living. Addressing issues like favoritism, controlling the tongue, and caring for the poor, James shows how Christian faith should impact every area of daily life. The letter is known for its direct, no-nonsense approach to Christian maturity and its insistence that "faith without works is dead."</p>

      <title type="sub">Joy in Testing</title>
      <verse osisID="Jas.1.2">Consider it complete joy, my brothers, when you fall into various trials,<note type="study">The Greek word πειρασμοῖς can mean both "trials" and "testing" - external circumstances that test one's faith.</note></verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.1.3">knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.1.4">And let endurance have its complete work, so that you may be complete and whole, lacking nothing.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Asking for Wisdom</title>
      <verse osisID="Jas.1.5">If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask from God, who gives to all generously and without finding fault, and it will be given to him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.1.6">But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.1.7">For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.1.8">he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Rich and Poor</title>
      <verse osisID="Jas.1.9">Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.1.10">and the rich in his humiliation, because like a flower of grass he will pass away.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.1.11">For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beauty perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Testing and Being Tested</title>
      <verse osisID="Jas.1.12">Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life, which he has promised to those who love him.<note type="study">The Greek word δόκιμος means "tested and approved" - like metals tested by fire.</note></verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.1.13">Let no one say when he is being tested, "I am being tested by God," for God cannot be tested with evil, and he himself tests no one.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.1.14">But each person is tested when he is lured and enticed by his own desire.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.1.15">Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to wrongdoing, and wrongdoing when it is fully grown brings forth death.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.1.16">Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Good Gifts from God</title>
      <verse osisID="Jas.1.17">Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.1.18">Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Hearing and Doing</title>
      <verse osisID="Jas.1.19">Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.1.20">for the anger of man does not produce the doing what's right that God requires.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.1.21">Therefore put away all filthiness and rampant wickedness and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.1.22">But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.1.23">For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.1.24">For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.1.25">But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Pure Religion</title>
      <verse osisID="Jas.1.26">If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this person's religion is worthless.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.1.27">Religion that is pure and undefiled before God the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.</verse>
      <chapter eID="Jas.1" />
      
      <chapter osisID="Jas.2" sID="Jas.2" />
      <title type="main">The Wrong of Favoritism</title>
      <verse osisID="Jas.2.1">My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.2.2">For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.2.3">and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, "You sit here in a good place," while you say to the poor man, "You stand over there," or, "Sit down at my feet,"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.2.4">have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.2.5">Listen, my beloved brothers, has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which he has promised to those who love him?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.2.6">But you have dishonored the poor man. Are not the rich the ones who oppress you, and the ones who drag you into court?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.2.7">Are they not the ones who speak against the good name that was called over you?</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">The Royal Law</title>
      <verse osisID="Jas.2.8">If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself," you are doing well.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.2.9">But if you show partiality, you are committing wrongdoing and are convicted by the law as transgressors.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.2.10">For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.2.11">For he who said, "Do not commit adultery," also said, "Do not murder." If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.2.12">So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.2.13">For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Faith and Works</title>
      <verse osisID="Jas.2.14">What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.2.15">If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.2.16">and one of you says to them, "Go in peace, be warmed and filled," without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.2.17">So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.2.18">But someone will say, "You have faith and I have works." Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.2.19">You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.2.20">Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.2.21">Was not Abraham our father declared to be in right standing with God by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.2.22">You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.2.23">and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, "Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as being in right standing with God"—and he was called a friend of God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.2.24">You see that a person is declared to be in right standing with God by works and not by faith alone.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.2.25">And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute declared to be in right standing with God by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.2.26">For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead.</verse>
      <chapter eID="Jas.2" />
      
      <chapter osisID="Jas.3" sID="Jas.3" />
      <title type="main">Controlling the Tongue</title>
      <verse osisID="Jas.3.1">Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.3.2">For we all stumble in many ways. And if anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle his whole body.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.3.3">If we put bits into the mouths of horses so that they obey us, we guide their whole bodies as well.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.3.4">Look at the ships also: though they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.3.5">So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great things.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">The Tongue Like Fire</title>
      <verse osisID="Jas.3.6">How great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire! And the tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteous wrongness. The tongue is set among our members, staining the whole body, setting on fire the entire course of life, and set on fire by hell.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.3.7">For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.3.8">but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.3.9">With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.3.10">From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.3.11">Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and salt water?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.3.12">Can a fig tree, my brothers, bear olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a salt pond yield fresh water.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Wisdom from Above</title>
      <verse osisID="Jas.3.13">Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.3.14">But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.3.15">This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.3.16">For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.3.17">But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.3.18">And a harvest of doing what's right is sown in peace by those who make peace.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Jas.4" sID="Jas.4" />
      <title type="main">Warning Against Worldliness</title>
      <verse osisID="Jas.4.1">What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.4.2">You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have, because you do not ask.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.4.3">You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.4.4">You adulterous people! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.4.5">Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says, "He yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us"?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.4.6">But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble."</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Drawing Near to God</title>
      <verse osisID="Jas.4.7">Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.4.8">Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you wrongdoers, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.4.9">Be wretched and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.4.10">Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Judging Others</title>
      <verse osisID="Jas.4.11">Do not speak evil against one another, brothers. The one who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks evil against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.4.12">There is only one lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Boasting About Tomorrow</title>
      <verse osisID="Jas.4.13">Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and make a profit"—</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.4.14">yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.4.15">Instead you ought to say, "If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.4.16">As it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.4.17">So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is wrongdoing.</verse>
      <chapter eID="Jas.4" />
      
      <chapter osisID="Jas.5" sID="Jas.5" />
      <title type="main">Warning to Rich Oppressors</title>
      <verse osisID="Jas.5.1">Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.5.2">Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth-eaten.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.5.3">Your gold and silver have corroded, and their corrosion will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up treasure in the last days.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.5.4">Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, are crying out against you, and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts.<note type="study">The Greek Κυρίου Σαβαὼθ means "Lord of hosts" - a title emphasizing God's authority over heavenly armies.</note></verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.5.5">You have lived on the earth in luxury and in self-indulgence. You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.5.6">You have condemned and murdered the one who does what's right, who does not resist you.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Patience in Suffering</title>
      <verse osisID="Jas.5.7">Be patient, therefore, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient about it, until it receives the early and the late rains.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.5.8">You also, be patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.5.9">Do not grumble against one another, brothers, so that you may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing at the door.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.5.10">As an example of suffering and patience, brothers, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.5.11">Behold, we consider those blessed who remained steadfast. You have heard of the steadfastness of Job, and you have seen the purpose of the Lord, how the Lord is compassionate and merciful.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Oaths and Prayer</title>
      <verse osisID="Jas.5.12">But above all, my brothers, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath, but let your "yes" be yes and your "no" be no, so that you may not fall under condemnation.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.5.13">Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.5.14">Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.5.15">And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed wrongdoing, he will be forgiven.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.5.16">Therefore, confess your wrongdoings to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of someone who does what's right has great power as it is working.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.5.17">Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed fervently that it might not rain, and for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.5.18">Then he prayed again, and heaven gave rain, and the earth bore its fruit.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Bringing Back the Wanderer</title>
      <verse osisID="Jas.5.19">My brothers, if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone brings him back,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jas.5.20">let him know that whoever brings back a wrongdoer from his wandering will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of wrongdoings.</verse>
