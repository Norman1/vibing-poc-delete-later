      <title type="main">Letter to the Galatians</title>
      <div type="introduction">
        <p>Paul wrote this passionate letter to counteract false teachers who were telling Gentile Christians they needed to follow Jewish law to be truly saved. The apostle vigorously defends the gospel of salvation by faith alone, arguing that adding works to faith actually undermines the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice. Galatians emphasizes Christian freedom from legalism while calling believers to live by the Spirit and serve one another in love.</p>

      <chapter osisID="Gal.1" sID="Gal.1" />
      <title type="sub">Opening Greeting</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.1.1" sID="Gal.1.1" />Paul, an apostle—sent not from men nor by a man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead—<verse eID="Gal.1.1" /> <verse osisID="Gal.1.2" sID="Gal.1.2" />and all the brothers and sisters with me, to the churches in Galatia:<verse eID="Gal.1.2" />
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.1.3" sID="Gal.1.3" />Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,<verse eID="Gal.1.3" /> <verse osisID="Gal.1.4" sID="Gal.1.4" />who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,<verse eID="Gal.1.4" /> <verse osisID="Gal.1.5" sID="Gal.1.5" />to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.<verse eID="Gal.1.5" />
      
      <title type="sub">No Other Good News</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.1.6" sID="Gal.1.6" />I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you to live in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different good news—<verse eID="Gal.1.6" /> <verse osisID="Gal.1.7" sID="Gal.1.7" />which is really no good news at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the good news of Christ.<verse eID="Gal.1.7" /> <verse osisID="Gal.1.8" sID="Gal.1.8" />But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a good news other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God's curse!<verse eID="Gal.1.8" /> <verse osisID="Gal.1.9" sID="Gal.1.9" />As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a good news other than what you accepted, let them be under God's curse!<verse eID="Gal.1.9" />
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.1.10" sID="Gal.1.10" />Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ.<verse eID="Gal.1.10" />
      
      <title type="sub">Paul Called by God</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.1.11" sID="Gal.1.11" />I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the good news I preached is not of human origin.<verse eID="Gal.1.11" /> <verse osisID="Gal.1.12" sID="Gal.1.12" />I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<verse eID="Gal.1.12" />
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.1.13" sID="Gal.1.13" />For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it.<verse eID="Gal.1.13" /> <verse osisID="Gal.1.14" sID="Gal.1.14" />I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers.<verse eID="Gal.1.14" /> <verse osisID="Gal.1.15" sID="Gal.1.15" />But when God, who set me apart from my mother's womb and called me by his grace, was pleased<verse eID="Gal.1.15" /> <verse osisID="Gal.1.16" sID="Gal.1.16" />to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, my immediate response was not to consult any human being.<verse eID="Gal.1.16" /> <verse osisID="Gal.1.17" sID="Gal.1.17" />I did not go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went into Arabia. Later I returned to Damascus.<verse eID="Gal.1.17" />
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.1.18" sID="Gal.1.18" />Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days.<verse eID="Gal.1.18" /> <verse osisID="Gal.1.19" sID="Gal.1.19" />I saw none of the other apostles—only James, the Lord's brother.<verse eID="Gal.1.19" /> <verse osisID="Gal.1.20" sID="Gal.1.20" />I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie.<verse eID="Gal.1.20" />
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.1.21" sID="Gal.1.21" />Then I went to Syria and Cilicia.<verse eID="Gal.1.21" /> <verse osisID="Gal.1.22" sID="Gal.1.22" />I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.<verse eID="Gal.1.22" /> <verse osisID="Gal.1.23" sID="Gal.1.23" />They only heard the report: "The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy."<verse eID="Gal.1.23" /> <verse osisID="Gal.1.24" sID="Gal.1.24" />And they praised God because of me.<verse eID="Gal.1.24" />
      
      <chapter eID="Gal.1" />
      
      <chapter osisID="Gal.2" sID="Gal.2" />
      <title type="sub">Paul Accepted by the Apostles</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.2.1" sID="Gal.2.1" />Then after fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem, this time with Barnabas. I took Titus along also.<verse eID="Gal.2.1" /> <verse osisID="Gal.2.2" sID="Gal.2.2" />I went in response to a revelation and, meeting privately with those esteemed as leaders, I presented to them the good news that I preach among the Gentiles. I wanted to be sure I was not running and had not been running my race in vain.<verse eID="Gal.2.2" /> <verse osisID="Gal.2.3" sID="Gal.2.3" />Yet not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek.<verse eID="Gal.2.3" /> <verse osisID="Gal.2.4" sID="Gal.2.4" />This matter arose because some false believers had infiltrated our ranks to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus and to make us slaves.<verse eID="Gal.2.4" /> <verse osisID="Gal.2.5" sID="Gal.2.5" />We did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the good news might be preserved for you.<verse eID="Gal.2.5" />
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.2.6" sID="Gal.2.6" />As for those who were held in high esteem—whatever they were makes no difference to me; God does not show favoritism—they added nothing to my message.<verse eID="Gal.2.6" /> <verse osisID="Gal.2.7" sID="Gal.2.7" />On the contrary, they recognized that I had been entrusted with the task of preaching the good news to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been to the circumcised.<verse eID="Gal.2.7" /> <verse osisID="Gal.2.8" sID="Gal.2.8" />For God, who was at work in Peter as an apostle to the circumcised, was also at work in me as an apostle to the Gentiles.<verse eID="Gal.2.8" /> <verse osisID="Gal.2.9" sID="Gal.2.9" />James, Cephas and John, those esteemed as pillars, gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship when they recognized the grace given to me. They agreed that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcised.<verse eID="Gal.2.9" /> <verse osisID="Gal.2.10" sID="Gal.2.10" />All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor, the very thing I had been eager to do all along.<verse eID="Gal.2.10" />
      
      <title type="sub">Paul Opposes Cephas</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.2.11" sID="Gal.2.11" />When Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned.<verse eID="Gal.2.11" /> <verse osisID="Gal.2.12" sID="Gal.2.12" />For before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself from the Gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group.<verse eID="Gal.2.12" /> <verse osisID="Gal.2.13" sID="Gal.2.13" />The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that by their hypocrisy even Barnabas was led astray.<verse eID="Gal.2.13" />
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.2.14" sID="Gal.2.14" />When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the good news, I said to Cephas in front of them all, "You are a Jew, yet you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. How is it, then, that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs?<verse eID="Gal.2.14" />
      
      <title type="sub">Justified by Faith</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.2.15" sID="Gal.2.15" />"We who are Jews by birth and not sinful Gentiles<verse eID="Gal.2.15" /> <verse osisID="Gal.2.16" sID="Gal.2.16" />know that a person is not declared right with God by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be declared right with God by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be declared right with God.<verse eID="Gal.2.16" />
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.2.17" sID="Gal.2.17" />"But if, in seeking to be declared right with God through Christ, we Jews find ourselves also among the sinners, doesn't that mean that Christ promotes sin? Absolutely not!<verse eID="Gal.2.17" /> <verse osisID="Gal.2.18" sID="Gal.2.18" />If I rebuild what I destroyed, then I really would be a lawbreaker.<verse eID="Gal.2.18" />
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.2.19" sID="Gal.2.19" />"For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God.<verse eID="Gal.2.19" /> <verse osisID="Gal.2.20" sID="Gal.2.20" />I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.<verse eID="Gal.2.20" /> <verse osisID="Gal.2.21" sID="Gal.2.21" />I do not set aside the grace of God, for if being right with God could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!"<verse eID="Gal.2.21" />
      
      <chapter eID="Gal.2" />
      
      <chapter osisID="Gal.3" sID="Gal.3" />
      <title type="sub">Faith or Works of the Law</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.3.1" sID="Gal.3.1" />You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified.<verse eID="Gal.3.1" /> <verse osisID="Gal.3.2" sID="Gal.3.2" />I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by believing what you heard?<verse eID="Gal.3.2" /> <verse osisID="Gal.3.3" sID="Gal.3.3" />Are you so foolish? After beginning by means of the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by means of the flesh?<verse eID="Gal.3.3" /> <verse osisID="Gal.3.4" sID="Gal.3.4" />Have you experienced so much in vain—if it really was in vain?<verse eID="Gal.3.4" /> <verse osisID="Gal.3.5" sID="Gal.3.5" />So again I ask, does God give you his Spirit and work miracles among you by the works of the law, or by your believing what you heard?<verse eID="Gal.3.5" /> <verse osisID="Gal.3.6" sID="Gal.3.6" />So also Abraham "believed God, and it was credited to him as being right with God."<verse eID="Gal.3.6" />
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.3.7" sID="Gal.3.7" />Understand, then, that those who have faith are children of Abraham.<verse eID="Gal.3.7" /> <verse osisID="Gal.3.8" sID="Gal.3.8" />Scripture foresaw that God would declare the Gentiles right with him by faith, and announced the good news in advance to Abraham: "All nations will be blessed through you."<verse eID="Gal.3.8" /> <verse osisID="Gal.3.9" sID="Gal.3.9" />So those who rely on faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.<verse eID="Gal.3.9" />
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.3.10" sID="Gal.3.10" />For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, as it is written: "Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law."<verse eID="Gal.3.10" /> <verse osisID="Gal.3.11" sID="Gal.3.11" />Clearly no one who relies on the law is declared right with God, because "those in right standing with God will live by faith."<verse eID="Gal.3.11" /> <verse osisID="Gal.3.12" sID="Gal.3.12" />The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, it says, "The person who does these things will live by them."<verse eID="Gal.3.12" /> <verse osisID="Gal.3.13" sID="Gal.3.13" />Christ bought us back from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: "Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole."<verse eID="Gal.3.13" /> <verse osisID="Gal.3.14" sID="Gal.3.14" />He bought us back in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.<verse eID="Gal.3.14" />
      
      <title type="sub">The Law and the Promise</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.3.15" sID="Gal.3.15" />Brothers and sisters, let me take an example from everyday life. Just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established, so it is in this case.<verse eID="Gal.3.15" /> <verse osisID="Gal.3.16" sID="Gal.3.16" />Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. Scripture does not say "and to seeds," meaning many people, but "and to your seed," meaning one person, who is Christ.<verse eID="Gal.3.16" /> <verse osisID="Gal.3.17" sID="Gal.3.17" />What I mean is this: The law, introduced 430 years later, does not set aside the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise.<verse eID="Gal.3.17" /> <verse osisID="Gal.3.18" sID="Gal.3.18" />For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on the promise; but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise.<verse eID="Gal.3.18" />
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.3.19" sID="Gal.3.19" />Why, then, was the law given at all? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come. The law was given through angels and entrusted to a mediator.<verse eID="Gal.3.19" /> <verse osisID="Gal.3.20" sID="Gal.3.20" />A mediator, however, implies more than one party; but God is one.<verse eID="Gal.3.20" />
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.3.21" sID="Gal.3.21" />Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then being right with God would certainly have come by the law.<verse eID="Gal.3.21" /> <verse osisID="Gal.3.22" sID="Gal.3.22" />But Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe.<verse eID="Gal.3.22" />
      
      <title type="sub">Children of God</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.3.23" sID="Gal.3.23" />Before the coming of this faith, we were held in custody under the law, locked up until the faith that was to come would be revealed.<verse eID="Gal.3.23" /> <verse osisID="Gal.3.24" sID="Gal.3.24" />So the law was our guardian<note type="translation">A pedagogue was a slave supervising children, not a teacher</note> until Christ came that we might be declared right with God through faith.<verse eID="Gal.3.24" /> <verse osisID="Gal.3.25" sID="Gal.3.25" />Now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.<verse eID="Gal.3.25" />
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.3.26" sID="Gal.3.26" />So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith,<verse eID="Gal.3.26" /> <verse osisID="Gal.3.27" sID="Gal.3.27" />for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.<verse eID="Gal.3.27" /> <verse osisID="Gal.3.28" sID="Gal.3.28" />There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.<verse eID="Gal.3.28" /> <verse osisID="Gal.3.29" sID="Gal.3.29" />If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.<verse eID="Gal.3.29" />
      
      <chapter eID="Gal.3" />
      
      <chapter osisID="Gal.4" sID="Gal.4" />
      <verse osisID="Gal.4.1" sID="Gal.4.1" />What I am saying is that as long as an heir is underage, he is no different from a slave, although he owns the whole estate.<verse eID="Gal.4.1" /> <verse osisID="Gal.4.2" sID="Gal.4.2" />The heir is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father.<verse eID="Gal.4.2" /> <verse osisID="Gal.4.3" sID="Gal.4.3" />So also, when we were underage, we were in slavery under the elemental spiritual forces of the world.<verse eID="Gal.4.3" /> <verse osisID="Gal.4.4" sID="Gal.4.4" />But when the set time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,<verse eID="Gal.4.4" /> <verse osisID="Gal.4.5" sID="Gal.4.5" />to buy back those under the law, that we might receive adoption to sonship.<verse eID="Gal.4.5" /> <verse osisID="Gal.4.6" sID="Gal.4.6" />Because you are his sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, "Abba, Father."<verse eID="Gal.4.6" /> <verse osisID="Gal.4.7" sID="Gal.4.7" />So you are no longer a slave, but God's child; and since you are his child, God has made you also an heir.<verse eID="Gal.4.7" />
      
      <title type="sub">Paul's Concern for the Galatians</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.4.8" sID="Gal.4.8" />Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods.<verse eID="Gal.4.8" /> <verse osisID="Gal.4.9" sID="Gal.4.9" />But now that you know God—or rather are known by God—how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable forces? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again?<verse eID="Gal.4.9" /> <verse osisID="Gal.4.10" sID="Gal.4.10" />You are observing special days and months and seasons and years!<verse eID="Gal.4.10" /> <verse osisID="Gal.4.11" sID="Gal.4.11" />I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you.<verse eID="Gal.4.11" />
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.4.12" sID="Gal.4.12" />I plead with you, brothers and sisters, become like me, for I became like you. You did me no wrong.<verse eID="Gal.4.12" /> <verse osisID="Gal.4.13" sID="Gal.4.13" />As you know, it was because of an illness that I first preached the good news to you,<verse eID="Gal.4.13" /> <verse osisID="Gal.4.14" sID="Gal.4.14" />and even though my illness was a trial to you, you did not treat me with contempt or scorn. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself.<verse eID="Gal.4.14" /> <verse osisID="Gal.4.15" sID="Gal.4.15" />Where, then, is your blessing of me now? I can testify that, if you could have done so, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.<verse eID="Gal.4.15" /> <verse osisID="Gal.4.16" sID="Gal.4.16" />Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?<verse eID="Gal.4.16" />
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.4.17" sID="Gal.4.17" />Those people are zealous to win you over, but for no good. What they want is to alienate you from us, so that you may have zeal for them.<verse eID="Gal.4.17" /> <verse osisID="Gal.4.18" sID="Gal.4.18" />It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always, not just when I am with you.<verse eID="Gal.4.18" /> <verse osisID="Gal.4.19" sID="Gal.4.19" />My dear children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you,<verse eID="Gal.4.19" /> <verse osisID="Gal.4.20" sID="Gal.4.20" />how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you!<verse eID="Gal.4.20" />
      
      <title type="sub">Hagar and Sarah</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.4.21" sID="Gal.4.21" />Tell me, you who want to be under the law, are you not aware of what the law says?<verse eID="Gal.4.21" /> <verse osisID="Gal.4.22" sID="Gal.4.22" />For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman.<verse eID="Gal.4.22" /> <verse osisID="Gal.4.23" sID="Gal.4.23" />His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a divine promise.<verse eID="Gal.4.23" />
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.4.24" sID="Gal.4.24" />These things are being taken figuratively: The women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar.<verse eID="Gal.4.24" /> <verse osisID="Gal.4.25" sID="Gal.4.25" />Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children.<verse eID="Gal.4.25" /> <verse osisID="Gal.4.26" sID="Gal.4.26" />But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother.<verse eID="Gal.4.26" /> <verse osisID="Gal.4.27" sID="Gal.4.27" />For it is written: "Be glad, barren woman, you who never bore a child; shout for joy and cry aloud, you who were never in labor; because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband."<verse eID="Gal.4.27" />
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.4.28" sID="Gal.4.28" />Now you, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise.<verse eID="Gal.4.28" /> <verse osisID="Gal.4.29" sID="Gal.4.29" />At that time the son born according to the flesh persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now.<verse eID="Gal.4.29" /> <verse osisID="Gal.4.30" sID="Gal.4.30" />But what does Scripture say? "Get rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman's son."<verse eID="Gal.4.30" /> <verse osisID="Gal.4.31" sID="Gal.4.31" />Therefore, brothers and sisters, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.<verse eID="Gal.4.31" />

      <title type="sub">Freedom in Christ</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.5.1" sID="Gal.5.1" />It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.<verse eID="Gal.5.1" />
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.5.2" sID="Gal.5.2" />Mark my words! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you at all.<verse eID="Gal.5.2" /> <verse osisID="Gal.5.3" sID="Gal.5.3" />Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law.<verse eID="Gal.5.3" /> <verse osisID="Gal.5.4" sID="Gal.5.4" />You who are trying to be declared right with God by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace.<verse eID="Gal.5.4" /> <verse osisID="Gal.5.5" sID="Gal.5.5" />For through the Spirit we eagerly await by faith the being in right standing with God for which we hope.<verse eID="Gal.5.5" /> <verse osisID="Gal.5.6" sID="Gal.5.6" />For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.<verse eID="Gal.5.6" />
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.5.7" sID="Gal.5.7" />You were running a good race. Who cut in on you to keep you from obeying the truth?<verse eID="Gal.5.7" /> <verse osisID="Gal.5.8" sID="Gal.5.8" />That kind of persuasion does not come from the one who calls you.<verse eID="Gal.5.8" /> <verse osisID="Gal.5.9" sID="Gal.5.9" />A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough.<verse eID="Gal.5.9" /> <verse osisID="Gal.5.10" sID="Gal.5.10" />I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view. The one who is throwing you into confusion, whoever that may be, will have to pay the penalty.<verse eID="Gal.5.10" /> <verse osisID="Gal.5.11" sID="Gal.5.11" />Brothers and sisters, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished.<verse eID="Gal.5.11" /> <verse osisID="Gal.5.12" sID="Gal.5.12" />As for those agitators, I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves!<verse eID="Gal.5.12" />
      
      <title type="sub">Life by the Spirit</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.5.13" sID="Gal.5.13" />You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love.<verse eID="Gal.5.13" /> <verse osisID="Gal.5.14" sID="Gal.5.14" />For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: "Love your neighbor as yourself."<verse eID="Gal.5.14" /> <verse osisID="Gal.5.15" sID="Gal.5.15" />If you bite and devour each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other.<verse eID="Gal.5.15" />
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.5.16" sID="Gal.5.16" />So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.<verse eID="Gal.5.16" /> <verse osisID="Gal.5.17" sID="Gal.5.17" />For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever you want.<verse eID="Gal.5.17" /> <verse osisID="Gal.5.18" sID="Gal.5.18" />But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.<verse eID="Gal.5.18" />
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.5.19" sID="Gal.5.19" />The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual sin, impurity and debauchery;<verse eID="Gal.5.19" /> <verse osisID="Gal.5.20" sID="Gal.5.20" />idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions<verse eID="Gal.5.20" /> <verse osisID="Gal.5.21" sID="Gal.5.21" />and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.<verse eID="Gal.5.21" />
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.5.22" sID="Gal.5.22" />But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,<verse eID="Gal.5.22" /> <verse osisID="Gal.5.23" sID="Gal.5.23" />gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.<verse eID="Gal.5.23" /> <verse osisID="Gal.5.24" sID="Gal.5.24" />Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.<verse eID="Gal.5.24" /> <verse osisID="Gal.5.25" sID="Gal.5.25" />Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.<verse eID="Gal.5.25" /> <verse osisID="Gal.5.26" sID="Gal.5.26" />Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other.<verse eID="Gal.5.26" />

      <verse osisID="Gal.6.1" sID="Gal.6.1" />Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin, you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently. But watch yourselves, or you also may be tempted.<verse eID="Gal.6.1" /> <verse osisID="Gal.6.2" sID="Gal.6.2" />Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.<verse eID="Gal.6.2" /> <verse osisID="Gal.6.3" sID="Gal.6.3" />If anyone thinks they are something when they are not, they deceive themselves.<verse eID="Gal.6.3" /> <verse osisID="Gal.6.4" sID="Gal.6.4" />Each one should test their own actions. Then they can take pride in themselves alone, without comparing themselves to someone else,<verse eID="Gal.6.4" /> <verse osisID="Gal.6.5" sID="Gal.6.5" />for each one should carry their own load.<verse eID="Gal.6.5" />
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.6.6" sID="Gal.6.6" />Nevertheless, the one who receives instruction in the word should share all good things with their instructor.<verse eID="Gal.6.6" />
      
      <verse osisID="Gal.6.7" sID="Gal.6.7" />Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.<verse eID="Gal.6.7" /> <verse osisID="Gal.6.8" sID="Gal.6.8" />Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.<verse eID="Gal.6.8" /> <verse osisID="Gal.6.9" sID="Gal.6.9" />Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.<verse eID="Gal.6.9" /> <verse osisID="Gal.6.10" sID="Gal.6.10" />Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.<verse eID="Gal.6.10" />

      <verse osisID="Gal.6.12" sID="Gal.6.12" />Those who want to impress people by means of the flesh are trying to compel you to be circumcised. The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ.<verse eID="Gal.6.12" /> <verse osisID="Gal.6.13" sID="Gal.6.13" />Not even those who are circumcised keep the law, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your circumcision in the flesh.<verse eID="Gal.6.13" /> <verse osisID="Gal.6.14" sID="Gal.6.14" />May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.<verse eID="Gal.6.14" /> <verse osisID="Gal.6.15" sID="Gal.6.15" />Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is the new creation.<verse eID="Gal.6.15" /> <verse osisID="Gal.6.16" sID="Gal.6.16" />Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule—to the Israel of God.<verse eID="Gal.6.16" />
