      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.1">In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, while I was among the exiles by the Kebar River, the heavens opened and I saw visions of God.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.2">On the fifth day of the month—it was the fifth year of King Jehoiachin's exile—</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.3">the word of Yahweh came directly to Ezekiel<note type="translation">Hebrew Yechezkel meaning "God strengthens"</note> the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Babylonians<note type="translation">Hebrew Kasdim (Chaldeans)</note> by the Kebar River. There the hand<note type="translation">Hebrew yad, meaning power or influence</note> of Yahweh was upon him.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">The Four Living Creatures</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.4">I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north—an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. In the center of the fire looked like glowing metal<note type="translation">Hebrew hashmal, possibly electrum, an alloy of gold and silver</note>.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.5">And in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was human,</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.6">but each of them had four faces and four wings.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.7">Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.8">Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. All four of them had faces and wings,</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.9">and the wings of one touched the wings of another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.10">Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a human being, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.11">Such were their faces. They each had two wings spreading out upward, each wing touching that of the creature on either side; and each had two other wings covering its body.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.12">Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.13">The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.14">The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">The Four Wheels</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.15">As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.16">This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like topaz<note type="translation">Hebrew tarshish, likely chrysolite or topaz</note>, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.17">As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not change direction as the creatures went.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.18">Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.19">When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.20">Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.21">When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">The Expanse and the Throne</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.22">Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked something like an expanse<note type="translation">Hebrew raqia, the dome of the sky</note>, sparkling like crystal, and awesome.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.23">Under the expanse their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.24">When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty<note type="translation">Hebrew Shaddai</note>, like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.25">Then there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads as they stood with lowered wings.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.26">Above the expanse over their heads was what looked like a throne of lapis lazuli<note type="translation">Hebrew sapphire stone, likely lapis lazuli</note>, and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.27">I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.28">Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Yahweh. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Ezek.2.2">As he spoke, the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet, and I heard him speaking to me.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.2.3">He said: "Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me; they and their ancestors have been in revolt against me to this very day.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Ezek.2.5">And whether they listen or fail to listen—for they are a rebellious people—they will know that a prophet has been among them.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.2.6">And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or their words. Do not be afraid, though briers and thorns are all around you and you live among scorpions. Do not be afraid of what they say or be terrified by them, though they are a rebellious people.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.2.7">You must speak my words to them, whether they listen or fail to listen, for they are rebellious.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.2.8">But you, son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not rebel like that rebellious people; open your mouth and eat what I give you."</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.2.9">Then I looked, and I saw a hand stretched out to me. In it was a scroll,</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.2.10">which he unrolled before me. On both sides of it were written words of lament and mourning and terrible sorrow<note type="translation">Hebrew hi, expressing grief and disaster</note>.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.2">So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.3">Then he said to me, "Son of man, eat this scroll I am giving you and fill your stomach with it." So I ate it, and it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.4">He then said to me: "Son of man, go now to the people of Israel and speak my words to them.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.5">You are not being sent to a people of obscure speech and strange language, but to the people of Israel—</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.6">not to many peoples of obscure speech and strange language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely if I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.7">But the people of Israel are not willing to listen to you because they are not willing to listen to me, for all the Israelites are hardened and obstinate.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.8">But I will make you as unyielding and hardened as they are.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.9">I will make your forehead like the hardest stone, harder than flint. Do not be afraid of them or terrified by them, though they are a rebellious people."</verse>

      <title type="sub">Ezekiel Returns to the Exiles</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.12">Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a loud rumbling sound as the glory of Yahweh rose from the place where it was.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.13">It was the sound of the wings of the living creatures brushing against each other and the sound of the wheels beside them, a loud rumbling sound.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.14">The Spirit then lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness and in the anger of my spirit, with the strong hand of Yahweh on me.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.15">I came to the exiles who lived at Tel Abib<note type="translation">Hebrew Tel Aviv, meaning "hill of grain" or "mound of the flood"</note> near the Kebar River. And there, where they were living, I sat among them for seven days—deeply distressed.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Ezekiel's Call as a Watchman</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.16">At the end of seven days the word of Yahweh came to me:</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.17">"Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the people of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.18">When I say to a wicked person, 'You will surely die,' and you do not warn them or speak out to dissuade them from their evil ways in order to save their life, that wicked person will die for their sin, and I will hold you accountable for their blood.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.19">But if you do warn the wicked person and they do not turn from their wickedness or from their evil ways, they will die for their sin; but you will have saved yourself.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.20">"Again, when a righteous person turns from their righteousness and does evil, and I put a stumbling block before them, they will die. Since you did not warn them, they will die for their sin. The righteous things that person did will not be remembered, and I will hold you accountable for their blood.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.21">But if you do warn the righteous person not to sin and they do not sin, they will surely live because they took warning, and you will have saved yourself."</verse>

      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.23">So I got up and went out to the plain. And the glory of Yahweh was standing there, like the glory I had seen by the Kebar River, and I fell facedown.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.24">Then the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet. He spoke to me and said: "Go, shut yourself inside your house.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.25">And you, son of man, they will tie with ropes; you will be bound so that you cannot go out among the people.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.26">I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be speechless and unable to rebuke them, for they are a rebellious people.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.27">But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth and you shall say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign Yahweh says.' Whoever will listen let them listen, and whoever will refuse let them refuse; for they are a rebellious people.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Ezek.8.1">In the sixth year, in the sixth month on the fifth day, while I was sitting in my house and the elders of Judah were sitting before me, the hand of the Sovereign Yahweh came on me there.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.8.2">I looked, and I saw a figure like that of a man. From what appeared to be his waist down he was like fire, and from there up his appearance was as bright as glowing metal.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.8.3">He stretched out what looked like a hand and took me by the hair of my head. The Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and in visions of God he took me to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the north gate of the inner court, where the idol that provokes to jealousy stood.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.8.4">And there before me was the glory of the God of Israel, as in the vision I had seen in the plain.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.8.5">Then he said to me, "Son of man, look toward the north." So I looked, and in the entrance north of the gate of the altar I saw this idol of jealousy.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.8.6">And he said to me, "Son of man, do you see what they are doing—the utterly detestable things the Israelites are doing here, things that will drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see things that are even more detestable."</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Idolatry in the Temple Courts</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.8.7">Then he brought me to the entrance to the court. I looked, and I saw a hole in the wall.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.8.8">He said to me, "Son of man, now dig into the wall." So I dug into the wall and saw a doorway there.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.8.9">And he said to me, "Go in and see the wicked and detestable things they are doing here."</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.8.10">So I went in and looked, and I saw portrayed all over the walls all kinds of crawling things and unclean animals and all the idols of Israel.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.8.11">In front of them stood seventy elders of Israel, and Jaazaniah son of Shaphan was standing among them. Each had a censer in his hand, and a fragrant cloud of incense was rising.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.8.12">He said to me, "Son of man, have you seen what the elders of Israel are doing in the darkness, each at the shrine of his own idol? They say, 'Yahweh does not see us; Yahweh has forsaken the land.'"</verse>

      <verse osisID="Ezek.8.14">Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of Yahweh, and I saw women sitting there, mourning the god Tammuz<note type="translation">Hebrew Tammuz, a Mesopotamian deity associated with fertility and the seasonal cycle</note>.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.8.15">He said to me, "Do you see this, son of man? You will see things that are even more detestable than this."</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.8.16">He then brought me into the inner court of the house of Yahweh, and there at the entrance to the temple, between the portico and the altar, were about twenty-five men. With their backs toward the temple of Yahweh and their faces toward the east, they were bowing down to the sun in the east.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.8.17">He said to me, "Have you seen this, son of man? Is it a trivial matter for the people of Judah to do the detestable things they are doing here? Must they also fill the land with violence and continually arouse my anger? Look at them putting the branch to their nose<note type="translation">The meaning of this phrase is uncertain, possibly referring to a ritual gesture</note>!</verse>

      <verse osisID="Ezek.9.3">Now the glory of the God of Israel went up from above the cherubim, where it had been, and moved to the threshold of the temple. Then Yahweh called to the man clothed in linen who had the writing kit at his side</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.9.4">and said to him, "Go throughout the city of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over all the detestable things that are done in it."</verse>

      <verse osisID="Ezek.9.6">Slaughter the old men, the young men and women, the mothers and children, but do not touch anyone who has the mark. Begin at my sanctuary." So they began with the old men who were in front of the temple.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Ezek.10.2">Yahweh said to the man clothed in linen, "Go in among the wheels beneath the cherubim. Fill your hands with burning coals from among the cherubim and scatter them over the city." And as I watched, he went in.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.10.3">Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Ezek.10.5">The sound of the wings of the cherubim could be heard as far away as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.10.6">When Yahweh commanded the man in linen, "Take fire from among the wheels, from among the cherubim," the man went in and stood beside a wheel.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.10.7">Then one of the cherubim reached out his hand to the fire that was among them. He took up some of it and put it into the hands of the man in linen, who took it and went out.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Ezek.10.11">As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the cherubim faced; the wheels did not turn about as the cherubim went. The cherubim went in whatever direction the head faced, without turning as they went.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.10.12">Their entire bodies, including their backs, their hands and their wings, were completely full of eyes, as were their four wheels.</verse>
