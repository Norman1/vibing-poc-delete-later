      <div type="introduction">
        <p>Ezekiel prophesied to the Jewish exiles in Babylon, using dramatic visions and symbolic acts to communicate God's messages. He explained why Jerusalem fell (due to idolatry and injustice), proclaimed judgment on surrounding nations, and offered hope of restoration. His visions include the valley of dry bones coming to life and a new temple with God's glory returning to dwell among his people.</p>

      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.1">In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, while I was among the exiles by the Kebar River, the heavens opened and I saw visions of God.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.2">On the fifth day of the month—it was the fifth year of King Jehoiachin's exile—</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.3">the word of Yahweh came directly to Ezekiel<note type="translation">Hebrew Yechezkel meaning "God strengthens"</note> the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Babylonians<note type="translation">Hebrew Kasdim (Chaldeans)</note> by the Kebar River. There the hand<note type="translation">Hebrew yad, meaning power or influence</note> of Yahweh was upon him.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">The Four Living Creatures</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.4">I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north—an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. In the center of the fire looked like glowing metal<note type="translation">Hebrew hashmal, possibly electrum, an alloy of gold and silver</note>.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.5">And in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was human,</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.6">but each of them had four faces and four wings.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.7">Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.8">Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. All four of them had faces and wings,</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.9">and the wings of one touched the wings of another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.10">Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a human being, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.11">Such were their faces. They each had two wings spreading out upward, each wing touching that of the creature on either side; and each had two other wings covering its body.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.12">Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.13">The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.14">The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">The Four Wheels</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.15">As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.16">This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like topaz<note type="translation">Hebrew tarshish, likely chrysolite or topaz</note>, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.17">As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not change direction as the creatures went.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.18">Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.19">When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.20">Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.21">When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">The Expanse and the Throne</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.22">Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked something like an expanse<note type="translation">Hebrew raqia, the dome of the sky</note>, sparkling like crystal, and awesome.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.23">Under the expanse their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.24">When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty<note type="translation">Hebrew Shaddai</note>, like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.25">Then there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads as they stood with lowered wings.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.26">Above the expanse over their heads was what looked like a throne of lapis lazuli<note type="translation">Hebrew sapphire stone, likely lapis lazuli</note>, and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.27">I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.1.28">Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Yahweh. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Ezek.2.1">He said to me, "Son of man<note type="translation">Hebrew ben adam, literally "son of Adam" or "human being"</note>, stand up on your feet and I will speak to you."</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.2.2">As he spoke, the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet, and I heard him speaking to me.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.2.3">He said: "Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me; they and their ancestors have been in revolt against me to this very day.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.2.4">The people to whom I am sending you are obstinate and stubborn. Say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign Yahweh<note type="translation">Hebrew Adonai Yahweh</note> says.'</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.2.5">And whether they listen or fail to listen—for they are a rebellious people—they will know that a prophet has been among them.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.2.6">And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or their words. Do not be afraid, though briers and thorns are all around you and you live among scorpions. Do not be afraid of what they say or be terrified by them, though they are a rebellious people.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.2.7">You must speak my words to them, whether they listen or fail to listen, for they are rebellious.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.2.8">But you, son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not rebel like that rebellious people; open your mouth and eat what I give you."</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.2.9">Then I looked, and I saw a hand stretched out to me. In it was a scroll,</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.2.10">which he unrolled before me. On both sides of it were written words of lament and mourning and terrible sorrow<note type="translation">Hebrew hi, expressing grief and disaster</note>.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.2">So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.3">Then he said to me, "Son of man, eat this scroll I am giving you and fill your stomach with it." So I ate it, and it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.4">He then said to me: "Son of man, go now to the people of Israel and speak my words to them.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.5">You are not being sent to a people of obscure speech and strange language, but to the people of Israel—</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.6">not to many peoples of obscure speech and strange language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely if I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.7">But the people of Israel are not willing to listen to you because they are not willing to listen to me, for all the Israelites are hardened and obstinate.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.8">But I will make you as unyielding and hardened as they are.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.9">I will make your forehead like the hardest stone, harder than flint. Do not be afraid of them or terrified by them, though they are a rebellious people."</verse>

      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.13">It was the sound of the wings of the living creatures brushing against each other and the sound of the wheels beside them, a loud rumbling sound.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.14">The Spirit then lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness and in the anger of my spirit, with the strong hand of Yahweh on me.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.15">I came to the exiles who lived at Tel Abib<note type="translation">Hebrew Tel Aviv, meaning "hill of grain" or "mound of the flood"</note> near the Kebar River. And there, where they were living, I sat among them for seven days—deeply distressed.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Ezekiel's Call as a Watchman</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.16">At the end of seven days the word of Yahweh came to me:</verse>

      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.18">When I say to a wicked person, 'You will surely die,' and you do not warn them or speak out to dissuade them from their evil ways in order to save their life, that wicked person will die for their sin, and I will hold you accountable for their blood.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.19">But if you do warn the wicked person and they do not turn from their wickedness or from their evil ways, they will die for their sin; but you will have saved yourself.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.20">"Again, when a person who does what's right turns from their doing what's right and does evil, and I put a stumbling block before them, they will die. Since you did not warn them, they will die for their sin. The right things that person did will not be remembered, and I will hold you accountable for their blood.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.21">But if you do warn the person who does what's right not to sin and they do not sin, they will surely live because they took warning, and you will have saved yourself."</verse>

      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.23">So I got up and went out to the plain. And the glory of Yahweh was standing there, like the glory I had seen by the Kebar River, and I fell facedown.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.24">Then the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet. He spoke to me and said: "Go, shut yourself inside your house.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.25">And you, son of man, they will tie with ropes; you will be bound so that you cannot go out among the people.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.26">I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be speechless and unable to rebuke them, for they are a rebellious people.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.3.27">But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth and you shall say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign Yahweh says.' Whoever will listen let them listen, and whoever will refuse let them refuse; for they are a rebellious people.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Ezek.40.2">In visions of God he took me to the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain, on whose south side were some buildings that looked like a city.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Ezek.40.4">The man said to me, "Son of man, look carefully and listen closely and pay attention to everything I am going to show you, for that is why you have been brought here. Tell the people of Israel everything you see."</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">The East Gate to the Outer Court</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.40.5">I saw a wall completely surrounding the temple area. The length of the measuring rod in the man's hand was six long cubits (about 3.2 meters), each of which was a cubit and a handbreadth. He measured the wall; it was one measuring rod thick and one rod high.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.40.6">Then he went to the east gate. He climbed its steps and measured the threshold of the gate; it was one rod deep.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.40.7">The alcoves for the guards were one rod long and one rod wide, and the projecting walls between the alcoves were five cubits thick. And the threshold of the gate next to the portico facing the temple was one rod deep.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Ezek.40.11">Then he measured the width of the entrance of the gateway; it was ten cubits and its length was thirteen cubits.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.40.12">In front of each alcove was a wall one cubit high, and the alcoves were six cubits square.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Ezek.47.2">He then brought me out through the north gate and led me around the outside to the outer gate facing east, and the water was trickling from the south side.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Ezek.47.3">As the man went eastward with a measuring line in his hand, he measured off a thousand cubits and then led me through water that was ankle-deep.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Ezek.47.5">He measured off another thousand, but now it was a river that I could not cross, because the water had risen and was deep enough to swim in—a river that no one could cross.</verse>
