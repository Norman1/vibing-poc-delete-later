      <chapter osisID="Mark.12" sID="Mark.12"/>
      <title type="main">The Parable of the Tenants</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.1">He began to speak to them in parables: "A man planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug out a wine vat, built a tower, rented it to tenants, and went away on a journey.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.2">At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the vineyard's fruit.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.3">But they seized him, beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.4">Again he sent another servant to them, and they struck him on the head and treated him shamefully.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.5">He sent yet another, and that one they killed. Many others he sent—some they beat, others they killed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.6">He still had one left, a beloved son. He sent him to them last, saying, 'They will respect my son.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.7">But those tenants said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.8">So they took him, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.9">What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.10">Haven't you read this Scripture: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.11">This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.12">They looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had spoken the parable against them. But they were afraid of the crowd, so they left him and went away.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Paying Taxes to Caesar</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.13">Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to trap him with his words.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.14">They came and said to him, "Teacher, we know that you are truthful and don't care what anyone thinks, for you don't show favoritism to people, but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it lawful to pay the poll tax to Caesar or not? Should we pay or shouldn't we?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.15">Knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, "Why are you testing me? Bring me a denarius<note type="translation">A denarius was worth about a day's wage for a laborer</note> and let me look at it."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.16">They brought the coin, and he asked them, "Whose image and inscription is this?" "Caesar's," they replied.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.17">Then Jesus said to them, "Give back to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's." And they were amazed at him.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Marriage at the Resurrection</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.18">Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.19">"Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.20">Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died without leaving any children.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.21">The second one married the widow, but he also died, leaving no child. It was the same with the third.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.22">In fact, none of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman died too.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.23">At the resurrection when they rise, whose wife will she be, since the seven were all married to her?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.24">Jesus replied, "Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.25">When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.26">Now about the dead rising—have you not read in the Book of Moses, in the account of the burning bush, how God said to him, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.27">He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!"</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Greatest Commandment</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.28">One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, "Of all the commandments, which is the most important?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.29">"The most important one," answered Jesus, "is this: 'Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.30">Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.31">The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.32">"Well said, teacher," the man replied. "You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.33">To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.34">When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Whose Son Is the Messiah?</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.35">While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, "Why do the teachers of the law say that the Messiah<note type="translation">Greek word "Christ" means "Anointed One" or "Messiah"</note> is the son of David?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.36">David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: "'The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.37">David himself calls him 'Lord.' How then can he be his son?" The large crowd listened to him with delight.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Warning Against the Teachers of the Law</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.38">As he taught, Jesus said, "Watch out for the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted with respect in the marketplaces,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.39">and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.40">They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will be punished most severely."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Widow's Offering</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.41">Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.42">But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins<note type="translation">Greek "lepta" - the smallest copper coins worth only a fraction of a denarius</note>, worth only a few cents.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.43">Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.12.44">They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything—all she had to live on."</verse>

      <title type="main">The Destruction of the Temple and Signs of the End Times</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.1">As Jesus was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Look, Teacher! What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.2">"Do you see all these great buildings?" replied Jesus. "Not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.3">As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John and Andrew asked him privately,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.4">"Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.5">Jesus said to them: "Watch out that no one deceives you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.6">Many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am he,' and will deceive many.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.7">When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.8">Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines. These are the beginning of birth pains.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Persecution of Believers</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.9">"You must be on your guard. You will be handed over to the local councils and flogged in the synagogues. On account of me you will stand before governors and kings as witnesses to them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.10">And the good news<note type="translation">Greek "euangelion" means good news or gospel</note> must first be preached to all nations.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.11">Whenever you are arrested and brought to trial, do not worry beforehand about what to say. Just say whatever is given you at the time, for it is not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.12">"Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.13">Everyone will hate you because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Abomination That Causes Desolation</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.14">"When you see 'the disgusting practice that causes desolation'<note type="translation">Greek "bdelugma tes eremoseos" refers to something abominable that makes a holy place desolate</note> standing where it does not belong—let the reader understand—then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.15">Let no one on the housetop go down or enter the house to take anything out.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.16">Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.17">How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.18">Pray that this will not take place in winter,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.19">because those will be days of distress unequaled from the beginning, when God created the world, until now—and never to be equaled again.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.20">"If the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would survive. But for the sake of the elect, whom he has chosen, he has shortened them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.21">At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Messiah!' or, 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.22">For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.23">So be on your guard; I have told you everything ahead of time.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Coming of the Son of Man</title>

      <verse osisID="Mark.13.25">the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.26">"At that time people will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.27">And he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Lesson of the Fig Tree</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.28">"Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.29">Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that it is near, right at the door.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.30">Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.31">Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Day and Hour Unknown</title>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.32">"But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.33">Be on guard! Be alert! You do not know when that time will come.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.34">It's like a man going away: He leaves his house and puts his servants in charge, each with their assigned task, and tells the one at the door to keep watch.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.35">"Therefore keep watch because you do not know when the owner of the house will come back—whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or at dawn.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.36">If he comes suddenly, do not let him find you sleeping.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Mark.13.37">What I say to you, I say to everyone: 'Watch!'"</verse>
