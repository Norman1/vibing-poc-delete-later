      <chapter osisID="1Pet.1" sID="1Pet.1"/>
      <title type="main">Hope and Living as God's Set Apart People</title>
      
      <verse osisID="1Pet.1.1">Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who are chosen temporary residents scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.1.2">according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the work of the Spirit that sets you apart, for obedience and sprinkling with the blood of Jesus Christ: May grace and peace be multiplied to you.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Praise for Living Hope</title>
      <verse osisID="1Pet.1.3">Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.1.4">into an inheritance that cannot decay, cannot be defiled, and will not fade away, kept safe in heaven for you</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.1.5">who are protected by God's power through faith for a rescue ready to be revealed in the last time.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.1.6">In this you rejoice greatly, even though for a little while now, if it must be so, you have been distressed by various trials,</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.1.7">so that the tested genuineness of your faith—more valuable than gold that perishes even though it is tested by fire—may result in praise and glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.1.8">Even though you have not seen him, you love him. Even though you do not see him now, yet believing, you rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory,</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.1.9">obtaining the goal of your faith: the rescue of your souls.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">The Prophets Searched for This Rescue</title>
      <verse osisID="1Pet.1.10">Concerning this rescue, the prophets who prophesied about the grace that would come to you searched and investigated carefully,</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.1.11">searching to find what person or what time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating when it testified in advance to the sufferings destined for Christ and the glories that would follow.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.1.12">It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you in these things, which have now been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you by the Spirit set apart for God sent from heaven—things into which angels long to look.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Live as Children of Obedience</title>
      <verse osisID="1Pet.1.13">Therefore, preparing your minds for action<note type="study">Greek: "girding up the loins of your mind"—an idiom meaning to get ready for action</note>, being fully sober-minded, set your hope completely on the grace that is being brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.1.14">As children of obedience, do not be conformed to the desires you formerly had in your ignorance,</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.1.15">but just as the one who called you is set apart for God, you yourselves also be set apart for God in all your conduct,</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.1.16">because it is written: "You shall be set apart for God, because I am set apart for God."</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="1Pet.1.17">And if you call upon the Father, who judges each person's work impartially, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your temporary residence,</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.1.18">knowing that you were not bought back from your meaningless way of life inherited from your ancestors with perishable things like silver or gold,</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.1.19">but with precious blood like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb—the blood of Christ.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.1.20">He was chosen before the foundation of the world but was revealed at the end of these times for your sake.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.1.21">Through him you are believers in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Love One Another Deeply</title>
      <verse osisID="1Pet.1.22">Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for sincere brotherly love, love one another earnestly from a pure heart,</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.1.23">since you have been born again, not from perishable seed but imperishable, through the living and enduring word of God.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.1.24">For "All flesh is like grass, and all its glory like the flower of grass. The grass withers, and the flower falls off,</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.1.25">but the word of the Lord endures forever." This is the word that was preached as good news to you.</verse>
      <chapter eID="1Pet.1"/>
      
      <chapter osisID="1Pet.2" sID="1Pet.2"/>
      <title type="main">Living as God's Chosen People</title>
      
      <verse osisID="1Pet.2.1">Therefore, putting away all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander,</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.2.2">like newborn babies, long for the pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up into rescue,</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.2.3">since you have tasted that the Lord is good.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">A Chosen People, A Living Temple</title>
      <verse osisID="1Pet.2.4">As you come to him, a living stone rejected by men but in God's sight chosen and precious,</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.2.5">you yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house, to be a priesthood set apart for God, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.2.6">For it stands in Scripture: "Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen and precious, and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame."</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.2.7">So the honor is for you who believe, but for those who do not believe, "The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,"</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.2.8">and "A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense." They stumble because they disobey the word, and to this they were also appointed.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="1Pet.2.9">But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a nation set apart for God, a people for God's own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.2.10">Once you were not a people, but now you are God's people; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Live Good Lives Among Unbelievers</title>
      <verse osisID="1Pet.2.11">Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against your soul.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.2.12">Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable, so that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Submit to Human Authority</title>
      <verse osisID="1Pet.2.13">Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme,</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.2.14">or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.2.15">For this is the will of God, that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.2.16">Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; rather, live as God's servants.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.2.17">Honor everyone. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the emperor.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Servants, Follow Christ's Example</title>
      <verse osisID="1Pet.2.18">Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle but also to the unjust.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.2.19">For this is a gracious thing, when, mindful of God, one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.2.20">For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure? But if when you do good and suffer for it you endure, this is a gracious thing in the sight of God.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.2.21">For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.2.22">He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.2.23">When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.2.24">He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to doing what is right. By his wounds you have been healed.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.2.25">For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</verse>
      <chapter eID="1Pet.2"/>
      
      <chapter osisID="1Pet.3" sID="1Pet.3"/>
      <title type="main">Living as Husbands and Wives</title>
      
      <verse osisID="1Pet.3.1">Likewise, wives, be subject to your own husbands, so that even if some do not obey the word, they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives,</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.3.2">when they see your respectful and pure conduct.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.3.3">Do not let your adorning be external—the braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry, or the clothing you wear—</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.3.4">but let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.3.5">For this is how the women set apart for God who hoped in God used to adorn themselves, by submitting to their own husbands,</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.3.6">as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. And you are her children, if you do good and do not fear anything that is frightening.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="1Pet.3.7">Likewise, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs with you of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Suffering for Doing Right</title>
      <verse osisID="1Pet.3.8">Finally, all of you, have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender heart, and a humble mind.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.3.9">Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.3.10">For "Whoever desires to love life and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit;</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.3.11">let him turn away from evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.3.12">For the eyes of the Lord are on those in right standing with God, and his ears are open to their prayer. But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil."</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="1Pet.3.13">Now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good?</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.3.14">But even if you should suffer for doing what is right, you are blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled,</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.3.15">but in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you;</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.3.16">yet do it with gentleness and respect, having a good conscience, so that, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.3.17">For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God's will, than for doing evil.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Christ's Example of Suffering</title>
      <verse osisID="1Pet.3.18">For Christ also suffered once for sins, the one in right standing with God for those not in right standing with God, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit,</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.3.19">in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison,</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.3.20">because they formerly did not obey, when God's patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.3.21">Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.3.22">who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.</verse>
      <chapter eID="1Pet.3"/>
      
      <chapter osisID="1Pet.4" sID="1Pet.4"/>
      <title type="main">Living for God</title>
      
      <verse osisID="1Pet.4.1">Since therefore Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves with the same way of thinking, for whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.4.2">so as to live for the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for human passions but for the will of God.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.4.3">For the time that is past suffices for doing what the Gentiles want to do, living in sensuality, passions, drunkenness, orgies, drinking parties, and lawless idolatry.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.4.4">With respect to this they are surprised when you do not join them in the same flood of debauchery, and they malign you;</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.4.5">but they will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.4.6">For this is why the gospel was preached even to those who are dead, that though judged in the flesh the way people are, they might live in the spirit the way God does.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Use Your Gifts to Serve Others</title>
      <verse osisID="1Pet.4.7">The end of all things is at hand; therefore be self-controlled and sober-minded for the sake of your prayers.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.4.8">Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sins.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.4.9">Show hospitality to one another without grumbling.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.4.10">As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God's varied grace:</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.4.11">whoever speaks, as one who speaks oracles of God; whoever serves, as one who serves by the strength that God supplies—in order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To him belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Suffering as a Christian</title>
      <verse osisID="1Pet.4.12">Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.4.13">But rejoice insofar as you share Christ's sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.4.14">If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.4.15">But let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or as a meddler.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.4.16">Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.4.17">For it is time for judgment to begin at the household of God; and if it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God?</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.4.18">And "If those in right standing with God are scarcely saved, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?"</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.4.19">Therefore let those who suffer according to God's will entrust their souls to a faithful Creator while doing good.</verse>
      <chapter eID="1Pet.4"/>
      
      <chapter osisID="1Pet.5" sID="1Pet.5"/>
      <title type="main">Instructions for Church Leaders and Members</title>
      
      <verse osisID="1Pet.5.1">So I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as well as a partaker in the glory that is going to be revealed:</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.5.2">shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly, as God would have you; not for shameful gain, but eagerly;</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.5.3">not domineering over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.5.4">And when the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.5.5">Likewise, you who are younger, be subject to the elders. Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble."</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Cast Your Anxieties on God</title>
      <verse osisID="1Pet.5.6">Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you,</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.5.7">casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.5.8">Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.5.9">Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.5.10">And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.5.11">To him be the dominion forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Final Greetings</title>
      <verse osisID="1Pet.5.12">By Silvanus, a faithful brother as I regard him, I have written briefly to you, exhorting and declaring that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.5.13">She who is at Babylon, who is likewise chosen, sends you greetings, and so does Mark, my son.</verse> 
      <verse osisID="1Pet.5.14">Greet one another with the kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.</verse>
