        <title>Naomi Loses Her Family</title>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.1">
          <note type="study" n="1">The period of the judges was roughly 1200-1000 BCE, a time of political chaos and moral decline in Israel.</note>
          Back when the judges ruled Israel, there was a famine in the land. A man from Bethlehem in Judah left with his wife and two sons to live temporarily in the country of Moab.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.2">
          <note type="study" n="2">Elimelech means "My God is King"; Naomi means "Pleasant"; Mahlon means "Sickness"; Chilion means "Wasting." These names foreshadow the story.</note>
          The man's name was Elimelech, his wife was Naomi, and his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion—they were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. They went to Moab and settled there.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.3">
          Then Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died, leaving her with just her two sons.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.4">
          <note type="study" n="3">Marrying Moabite women violated Israelite customs, as Moabites were traditional enemies and worshiped other gods.</note>
          The sons married Moabite women—one named Orpah and the other Ruth. They lived there about ten years,
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.5">
          and then both Mahlon and Chilion died too. Naomi was left completely alone, without her sons or her husband.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.6">
          <note type="study" n="4">"Yahweh had visited" is Hebrew idiom meaning God had acted favorably, ending the famine.</note>
          When Naomi heard in Moab that Yahweh had come to help his people by providing food for them, she and her daughters-in-law prepared to return home from there.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.7">
          She left the place where she had been living, with both daughters-in-law accompanying her, and they started walking back to the land of Judah.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.8">
          <note type="study" n="5">Hesed means covenant loyalty or steadfast love—a key theme in Ruth.</note>
          But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, "Go back home, each of you to your mother's house. May Yahweh show you the same loyalty you've shown to your dead husbands and to me.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.9">
          May Yahweh help each of you find security in the home of a new husband." Then she kissed them goodbye, and they all broke down crying.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.10">
          "No," they said to her, "we're going back with you to your people."
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.11">
          But Naomi replied, "Go back home, my daughters. Why come with me? Do you think I could have more sons who could become your husbands?
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.12">
          <note type="study" n="6">Naomi refers to levirate marriage, where a brother-in-law marries his dead brother's widow to continue the family line.</note>
          Go back home, my daughters. I'm too old to remarry. Even if I thought there was still hope—even if I got married tonight and then gave birth to sons—
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.13">
          would you wait for them to grow up? Would you stay single for them? No, my daughters. My situation is far more bitter than yours, because Yahweh has turned against me!"
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.14">
          They cried together again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth held on tight to her.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.15">
          <note type="study" n="7">"Gods" refers to Chemosh, the chief deity of Moab.</note>
          "Look," said Naomi, "your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her."
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.16">
          But Ruth replied, "Don't pressure me to leave you or turn back from following you. Wherever you go, I'll go. Wherever you stay, I'll stay. Your people will be my people, and your God will be my God.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.17">
          <note type="study" n="8">Ruth invokes a covenant oath formula, calling for divine punishment if she breaks her promise.</note>
          Where you die, I'll die, and there I'll be buried. May Yahweh punish me severely if anything but death separates us."
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.18">
          When Naomi realized Ruth was absolutely determined to go with her, she stopped arguing.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.19">
          <note type="study" n="9">Bethlehem means "House of Bread"—ironic since they left due to famine.</note>
          So the two of them continued on until they reached Bethlehem. When they arrived, the whole town was stirred up about them. The women exclaimed, "Can this really be Naomi?"
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.20">
          <note type="study" n="10">Mara means "Bitter," contrasting with Naomi meaning "Pleasant."</note>
          "Don't call me Naomi," she told them. "Call me Mara, because the Almighty has made my life very bitter.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.21">
          <note type="study" n="11">Shaddai (Almighty) emphasizes God's power over circumstances.</note>
          I left here full, but Yahweh has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi when Yahweh has testified against me and the Almighty has brought disaster on me?"
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.1.22">
          <note type="study" n="12">Barley harvest was in April-May, the beginning of the harvest season.</note>
          So Naomi returned from Moab with Ruth the Moabite, her daughter-in-law. They arrived in Bethlehem just as the barley harvest was beginning.

        <title>Ruth Meets Boaz</title>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.1">
          <note type="study" n="13">"Mighty man of valor" can mean wealthy landowner or respected community leader.</note>
          Now Naomi had a relative on her husband's side, a prominent and wealthy man from Elimelech's clan, whose name was Boaz.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.2">
          <note type="study" n="14">Gleaning was a provision in Israelite law allowing the poor to gather leftover grain (Leviticus 19:9-10).</note>
          Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, "Let me go to the fields and pick up leftover grain behind anyone who shows me kindness." Naomi replied, "Go ahead, my daughter."
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.3">
          So she went out, entered a field, and began gleaning behind the harvesters. As it turned out, she found herself working in a field belonging to Boaz, who was from Elimelech's clan.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.4">
          <note type="study" n="15">This greeting exchange shows Boaz's godly character and good relationship with his workers.</note>
          Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters, "May Yahweh be with you!" "May Yahweh bless you!" they replied.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.5">
          Boaz asked the foreman of his harvesters, "Who does that young woman belong to?"
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.6">
          The foreman replied, "She's the young Moabite woman who came back with Naomi from Moab.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.7">
          <note type="study" n="16">Ruth asked permission to glean, showing respect for property rights despite her legal right to glean.</note>
          She said, 'Please let me glean and gather among the bundles behind the harvesters.' She came and has been working steadily from morning till now, except for a short rest in the shelter."
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.8">
          <note type="study" n="17">"My daughter" was a respectful way older men addressed younger women.</note>
          So Boaz said to Ruth, "Listen carefully, my daughter. Don't go gleaning in another field and don't leave this one. Stay here close to my female workers.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.9">
          Watch which field they're harvesting and follow along after them. I've ordered the men not to bother you. And whenever you're thirsty, go get a drink from the water jars the men have filled."
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.10">
          <note type="study" n="18">Bowing face-down showed deep gratitude and humility.</note>
          Ruth bowed down with her face to the ground. She asked him, "Why have I found such favor in your eyes that you notice me—a foreigner?"
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.11">
          Boaz replied, "I've been told all about what you've done for your mother-in-law since your husband died—how you left your father and mother and your homeland to come live with people you didn't know before.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.12">
          <note type="study" n="19">"Under whose wings" uses imagery of a bird protecting its young, depicting God as protector.</note>
          May Yahweh repay you for what you've done. May you be richly rewarded by Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you've come to take refuge."
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.13">
          "May I continue to find favor in your eyes, my lord," she said. "You've comforted me and spoken kindly to your servant—though I don't even have the status of one of your female servants."
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.14">
          <note type="study" n="20">Sharing a meal indicated acceptance and protection. Wine vinegar was a common condiment.</note>
          At mealtime Boaz said to her, "Come over here. Have some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar." When she sat down with the harvesters, he offered her roasted grain. She ate all she wanted and had some left over.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.15">
          As she got up to glean, Boaz gave orders to his men: "Let her gather among the bundles themselves and don't embarrass her.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.16">
          <note type="study" n="21">Boaz goes beyond the law's requirements, deliberately leaving extra grain for Ruth.</note>
          In fact, pull out some stalks from the bundles for her and leave them for her to pick up. And don't scold her!"
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.17">
          <note type="study" n="22">An ephah was about 22 liters or 5 gallons—an exceptional amount for one day's gleaning.</note>
          So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening. When she threshed what she had gathered, it amounted to about an ephah of barley.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.18">
          She carried it back to town, and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered. Ruth also brought out and gave her what she had left over after eating her fill.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.19">
          Her mother-in-law asked her, "Where did you glean today? Where did you work? May whoever noticed you be blessed!" Then Ruth told her mother-in-law about the one at whose place she had been working. "The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz," she said.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.20">
          <note type="study" n="23">"Kinsman-redeemer" (go'el) was a close relative who could buy back family property or marry a widow to continue the family line.</note>
          "May he be blessed by Yahweh, who hasn't stopped showing his loyal love to the living and the dead!" Naomi added, "That man is our close relative; he's one of our kinsman-redeemers."
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.21">
          Ruth the Moabite said, "He even told me, 'Stay with my workers until they finish harvesting all my grain.'"
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.22">
          Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, "It's good, my daughter, that you go out with his female workers, so that people don't harass you in someone else's field."
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.2.23">
          <note type="study" n="24">The barley and wheat harvests together lasted about seven weeks, from Passover to Pentecost.</note>
          So Ruth stayed close to Boaz's female workers, gleaning until the barley and wheat harvests were finished. And she lived with her mother-in-law.

        <title>Ruth's Bold Request</title>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.3.1">
          One day Naomi, Ruth's mother-in-law, said to her, "My daughter, shouldn't I try to find a secure home for you where you'll be well provided for?

        <verse osisID="Ruth.3.2">
          <note type="study" n="25">Winnowing involved tossing grain in the air so wind could blow away the chaff. Done in evening when winds were favorable.</note>
          Now Boaz, with whose female workers you've been, is our relative. Tonight he'll be winnowing barley on the threshing floor.

          <note type="study" n="26">These preparations suggest Ruth is presenting herself as available for marriage.</note>
          Wash yourself, put on perfume, and dress in your best clothes. Then go down to the threshing floor, but don't let him know you're there until he's finished eating and drinking.

        <verse osisID="Ruth.3.4">
          <note type="study" n="27">"Uncover his feet" and "lie down" use language with potential sexual overtones, but the context indicates Ruth acts honorably.</note>
          When he lies down, note the place where he's lying. Then go, uncover his feet, and lie down. He'll tell you what to do."

          "I'll do everything you say," Ruth answered.

          <note type="study" n="28">Men slept at the threshing floor to guard the grain from thieves.</note>
          When Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in good spirits, he went to lie down at the far end of the grain pile. Ruth approached quietly, uncovered his feet, and lay down.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="Ruth.3.8">
          In the middle of the night, the man was startled and turned over—and there was a woman lying at his feet!

          <note type="study" n="29">"Spread your garment" uses the same Hebrew word as "wings" in 2:12, connecting God's protection with Boaz's role.</note>

          Stay here tonight, and in the morning, if he wants to fulfill his duty as your kinsman-redeemer, good—let him redeem you. But if he's not willing, as surely as Yahweh lives, I will do it. Lie here until morning."
