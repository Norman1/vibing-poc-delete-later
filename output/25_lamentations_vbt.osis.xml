      <title type="main">Jerusalem's Desolation and Suffering</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.1.1">How lonely sits the city that was full of people! She who was great among the nations has become like a widow. The princess among the provinces has become a forced laborer.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.1.2">She weeps bitterly at night, and her tears are on her cheeks. She has no one to comfort her among all her lovers. All her friends have betrayed her; they have become her enemies.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.1.3">Judah has gone into exile because of affliction and harsh slavery. She lives among the nations but finds no rest. All her pursuers have overtaken her in her distress.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.1.4">The roads to Zion mourn because no one comes to the appointed feasts. All her gates are desolate; her priests groan. Her young women are grieving, and she is bitter.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.1.5">Her enemies have become her masters; her foes prosper. For Yahweh<note type="translation">Hebrew: יהוה (YHWH)</note> has afflicted her because of her many transgressions. Her children have gone away as captives before the enemy.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.1.6">All her splendor has departed from the daughter of Zion. Her princes have become like deer that find no pasture; they flee without strength before the pursuer.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.1.7">In the days of her affliction and wandering, Jerusalem remembers all the precious things she had from days of old. When her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and no one helped her, the enemies looked at her and mocked her destruction.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.1.8">Jerusalem has sinned greatly; therefore she has become unclean. All who honored her despise her, for they have seen her nakedness. She herself groans and turns her face away.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.1.9">Her uncleanness was in her skirts; she did not think about her future. Therefore she has fallen astonishingly; she has no comforter. "Look, Yahweh, at my affliction, for the enemy has triumphed."</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.1.10">The enemy has stretched out his hand over all her precious things. She has seen nations enter her sanctuary—those you commanded not to enter your assembly.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.1.11">All her people groan as they search for bread. They have traded their treasures for food to restore their lives. "Look, Yahweh, and see how worthless I have become."</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.1.12">"Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? Look and see: Is there any sorrow like my sorrow that was dealt to me, which Yahweh brought on me in the day of his fierce anger?"</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.1.13">"From on high he sent fire; it went down into my bones. He spread a net for my feet and turned me back. He made me desolate, faint all day long."</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.1.14">"My transgressions were bound into a yoke; by his hand they were woven together. They have come up on my neck; he has made my strength fail. The Lord<note type="translation">Hebrew: אדני (Adonai)</note> has handed me over to those I cannot resist."</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.1.15">"The Lord has rejected all the mighty men in my midst. He summoned an assembly against me to crush my young men. The Lord has trampled the virgin daughter of Judah like grapes in a wine press."</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.1.16">"For these things I weep; my eyes flow with tears. For a comforter is far from me, one who could restore my life. My children are desolate because the enemy has prevailed."</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.1.17">Zion stretches out her hands, but there is no one to comfort her. Yahweh has commanded concerning Jacob that his neighbors should be his enemies. Jerusalem has become unclean among them.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.1.18">"Yahweh is in the right, for I have rebelled against his command. Listen, all you peoples, and see my pain. My young women and young men have gone into captivity."</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.1.19">"I called to my lovers, but they deceived me. My priests and elders perished in the city while seeking food to restore their lives."</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.1.20">"Look, Yahweh, for I am in distress; my stomach churns. My heart is overturned within me, for I have been very rebellious. In the street the sword kills; at home it is like death."</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.1.21">"They have heard that I groan, but there is no one to comfort me. All my enemies have heard of my trouble; they rejoice that you have done it. Bring the day you have announced, so that they may become like me."</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.1.22">"Let all their wickedness come before you, and deal with them as you have dealt with me because of all my transgressions. For my groans are many, and my heart is sick."</verse>

      <title type="main">God's Anger and Punishment</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.2.1">How the Lord has covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger! He has thrown down from heaven to earth the beauty of Israel. He has not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.2.2">The Lord has swallowed up without pity all the dwellings of Jacob. In his wrath he has torn down the strongholds of the daughter of Judah. He has brought her kingdom and its princes down to the ground in dishonor.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.2.3">In fierce anger he has cut off all the strength of Israel. He has withdrawn his right hand from before the enemy. He has burned against Jacob like a flaming fire that consumes all around.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.2.4">He has bent his bow like an enemy; his right hand is set like a foe. He has killed all who were pleasing to the eye. In the tent of the daughter of Zion, he has poured out his wrath like fire.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.2.5">The Lord has become like an enemy; he has swallowed up Israel. He has swallowed up all her palaces; he has destroyed her strongholds. He has multiplied mourning and lamentation for the daughter of Judah.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.2.6">He has violently removed his booth like a garden shelter; he has destroyed his meeting place. Yahweh has made Zion forget both appointed feast and Sabbath. In his fierce anger he has despised both king and priest.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.2.7">The Lord has rejected his altar; he has abandoned his sanctuary. He has delivered the walls of her palaces into the hand of the enemy. They have raised a shout in the house of Yahweh as on the day of an appointed feast.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.2.8">Yahweh determined to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion. He stretched out the measuring line; he did not restrain his hand from destroying. He made rampart and wall lament; together they waste away.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.2.9">Her gates have sunk into the ground; he has ruined and broken her bars. Her king and princes are among the nations where the law is not. Moreover, her prophets find no vision from Yahweh.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.2.10">The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground in silence. They have thrown dust on their heads; they have put on sackcloth. The young women of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.2.11">My eyes fail with tears; my stomach churns. My liver is poured out on the ground because of the destruction of the daughter of my people, because infants and nursing babies faint in the squares of the city.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.2.12">They say to their mothers, "Where is grain and wine?" as they faint like wounded men in the squares of the city, as their life is poured out on their mothers' chest.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.2.13">What can I say for you? To what can I compare you, daughter of Jerusalem? What can I liken to you, that I may comfort you, virgin daughter of Zion? For your ruin is as vast as the sea; who can heal you?</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.2.14">Your prophets have seen for you false and worthless visions. They have not exposed your sin to restore your fortunes, but have seen for you oracles that are false and misleading.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.2.15">All who pass by clap their hands at you. They hiss and wag their heads at the daughter of Jerusalem: "Is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty, the joy of all the earth?"</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.2.16">All your enemies open their mouths against you. They hiss and gnash their teeth; they say, "We have swallowed her up. This is indeed the day we have waited for; we have found it; we have seen it."</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.2.17">Yahweh has done what he planned; he has carried out his word that he commanded long ago. He has thrown down without pity; he has made the enemy rejoice over you and exalted the horn of your foes.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.2.18">Their heart cried to the Lord: "O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears flow down like a river day and night! Give yourself no relief; let your eyes have no rest!"</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.2.19">"Arise, cry out in the night at the beginning of the night watches! Pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord! Lift up your hands to him for the lives of your children, who faint from hunger at the head of every street."</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.2.20">"Look, Yahweh, and see! With whom have you dealt thus? Should women eat their offspring, the children they have nursed? Should priest and prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?"</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.2.21">"Young and old lie on the ground in the streets; my young women and my young men have fallen by the sword. You have killed them in the day of your anger; you have slaughtered without pity."</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Lam.2.22">"You summoned as to a festival day my terrors on every side, and on the day of Yahweh's anger no one escaped or survived. Those whom I held and raised, my enemy destroyed."</verse>
