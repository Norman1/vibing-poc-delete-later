      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.1"><name type="person">Solomon</name> son of <name type="person">David</name> established himself firmly in his kingdom, and <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> his God was with him and made him exceedingly great.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.2">Then <name type="person">Solomon</name> spoke to all <name type="place">Israel</name>—to the commanders of thousands and hundreds, to the judges and to every leader in all <name type="place">Israel</name>, the heads of families.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.3"><name type="person">Solomon</name> and the whole assembly went to the high place at <name type="place">Gibeon</name>, for God's tent of meeting was there, which <name type="person">Moses</name> the servant of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> had made in the wilderness.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.4">But <name type="person">David</name> had brought up the ark of God from <name type="place">Kiriath Jearim</name> to the place he had prepared for it, because he had pitched a tent for it in <name type="place">Jerusalem</name>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.5">But the bronze altar that <name type="person">Bezalel</name> son of <name type="person">Uri</name>, the son of <name type="person">Hur</name>, had made was in <name type="place">Gibeon</name> in front of the tabernacle of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>; so <name type="person">Solomon</name> and the assembly inquired of him there.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.6"><name type="person">Solomon</name> went up to the bronze altar before <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> in the tent of meeting and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.7">That night God appeared to <name type="person">Solomon</name> and said to him, "Ask for whatever you want me to give you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.8"><name type="person">Solomon</name> answered God, "You have shown great kindness to <name type="person">David</name> my father and have made me king in his place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.9">Now, <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> God, let your promise to my father <name type="person">David</name> be confirmed, for you have made me king over a people who are as numerous as the dust of the earth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.10">Give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may lead this people, for who is able to govern this great people of yours?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.11">God said to <name type="person">Solomon</name>, "Since this is your heart's desire and you have not asked for wealth, possessions or honor, nor for the death of your enemies, and since you have not asked for a long life but for wisdom and knowledge to govern my people over whom I have made you king,</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.12">therefore wisdom and knowledge will be given you. And I will also give you wealth, possessions and honor, such as no king who was before you ever had and none after you will have."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.13">Then <name type="person">Solomon</name> went to <name type="place">Jerusalem</name> from the high place at <name type="place">Gibeon</name>, from before the tent of meeting. And he reigned over <name type="place">Israel</name>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.14"><name type="person">Solomon</name> accumulated chariots and horses; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses, which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in <name type="place">Jerusalem</name>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.15">The king made silver and gold as common in <name type="place">Jerusalem</name> as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.16"><name type="person">Solomon</name>'s horses were imported from <name type="place">Egypt</name> and from <name type="place">Kue</name>—the royal merchants purchased them from <name type="place">Kue</name> at the current price.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.17">They imported a chariot from <name type="place">Egypt</name> for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. They also exported them to all the kings of the <name type="people">Hittites</name> and <name type="people">Arameans</name>.</verse>

      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.1"><name type="person">Solomon</name> gave orders to build a temple for the Name of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> and a royal palace for himself.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.2">He conscripted 70,000 men as carriers and 80,000 as stonecutters in the hills and 3,600 as supervisors over them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.3"><name type="person">Solomon</name> sent this message to <name type="person">Hiram</name> king of <name type="place">Tyre</name>: "As you dealt with my father <name type="person">David</name> and sent him cedar to build a palace to live in, now do the same for me.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.4">Now I am about to build a temple for the Name of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> my God and to dedicate it to him for burning fragrant incense before him, for setting out the consecrated bread regularly, and for making burnt offerings every morning and evening and on the Sabbaths, at the New Moons and at the appointed festivals of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> our God. This is a lasting ordinance for <name type="place">Israel</name>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.5">The temple I am going to build will be great, because our God is greater than all other gods.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.6">But who is able to build a temple for him, since the heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain him? Who then am I to build a temple for him, except as a place to burn sacrifices before him?</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.7">Send me, therefore, a man skilled to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, and in purple, crimson and blue yarn, and experienced in the art of engraving, to work in <name type="place">Judah</name> and <name type="place">Jerusalem</name> with my skilled workers, whom my father <name type="person">David</name> provided.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.8">Send me also cedar, juniper and algum logs from <name type="place">Lebanon</name>, for I know that your servants are skilled in cutting timber there. My servants will work with yours</verse>

      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.10">I will give your servants, the woodcutters who cut the timber, twenty thousand cors of ground wheat, twenty thousand cors of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine and twenty thousand baths of olive oil."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.11"><name type="person">Hiram</name> king of <name type="place">Tyre</name> replied by letter to <name type="person">Solomon</name>: "Because <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> loves his people, he has made you their king."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.12">And <name type="person">Hiram</name> added: "Praise be to <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, the God of <name type="place">Israel</name>, who made heaven and earth! He has given King <name type="person">David</name> a wise son, endowed with intelligence and discernment, who will build a temple for <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> and a palace for himself.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.13">I am sending you <name type="person">Huram-Abi</name>, a man of great skill,</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.14">whose mother was from <name type="place">Dan</name> and whose father was from <name type="place">Tyre</name>. He is trained to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, stone and wood, and with purple and blue and crimson yarn and fine linen. He is experienced in all kinds of engraving and can execute any design given to him. He will work with your skilled workers and with those of my lord, <name type="person">David</name> your father.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.15">Now let my lord send his servants the wheat and barley and the olive oil and wine he promised,</verse>

      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.17"><name type="person">Solomon</name> took a census of all the foreigners residing in <name type="place">Israel</name>, after the census his father <name type="person">David</name> had taken; and they were found to be 153,600.</verse>

      <title type="section">Solomon Builds the Temple</title>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.1">Then <name type="person">Solomon</name> began to build the temple of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> in <name type="place">Jerusalem</name> on <name type="place">Mount Moriah</name>, where <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> had appeared to his father <name type="person">David</name>. It was on the threshing floor of <name type="person">Araunah</name> the <name type="people">Jebusite</name>, the place provided by <name type="person">David</name>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.2">He began building on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.3">The foundation <name type="person">Solomon</name> laid for building the temple of God was sixty cubits long and twenty cubits wide (using the cubit of the old standard).</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.4">The portico at the front of the temple was twenty cubits long across the width of the building and twenty cubits high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.5">He paneled the main hall with juniper and covered it with fine gold and decorated it with palm tree and chain designs.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.6">He adorned the temple with precious stones for beauty. And the gold he used was gold of <name type="place">Parvaim</name>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.7">He overlaid the ceiling beams, doorframes, walls and doors of the temple with gold, and he carved cherubim on the walls.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.8">He built the inner sanctuary, its length corresponding to the width of the temple—twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide. He overlaid the inside with six hundred talents of fine gold.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.9">The gold nails weighed fifty shekels. He also overlaid the upper parts with gold.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.10">For the inner sanctuary he made a pair of sculptured cherubim and overlaid them with gold.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.11">The total wingspan of the cherubim was twenty cubits. One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long and touched the temple wall, while its other wing, also five cubits long, touched the wing of the other cherub.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.12">Similarly, one wing of the second cherub was five cubits long and touched the other temple wall, and its other wing, also five cubits long, touched the wing of the first cherub.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.13">The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits. They stood on their feet, facing the main hall.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.14">He made the curtain of blue, purple and crimson yarn and fine linen, with cherubim worked into it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.15">For the front of the temple he made two pillars, which together were thirty-five cubits long, each with a capital five cubits high.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.16">He made interwoven chains and put them on top of the pillars. He also made a hundred pomegranates and attached them to the chains.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.17">He erected the pillars in the front of the temple, one to the south and one to the north. The one to the south he named <name type="place">Jakin</name> and the one to the north <name type="place">Boaz</name>.</verse>

      <title type="section">The Temple's Furnishings</title>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.1">He made a bronze altar twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide and ten cubits high.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.2">He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty cubits to measure around it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.3">Below the rim, figures of bulls encircled it—ten to a cubit. The bulls were cast in two rows in one piece with the Sea.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.4">The Sea stood on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were toward the center.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.5">It was a handbreadth thick, and its rim was like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held three thousand baths.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.6">He then made ten basins for washing and placed five on the south side and five on the north. In them the things to be used for the burnt offerings were rinsed, but the Sea was to be used by the priests for washing.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.7">He made ten gold lampstands according to the specifications for them and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.8">He made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north. He also made a hundred gold sprinkling bowls.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.9">He made the courtyard of the priests, and the large court and the doors for the court, and overlaid the doors with bronze.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.10">He placed the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.11">And <name type="person">Huram</name> also made the pots and shovels and sprinkling bowls. So <name type="person">Huram</name> finished the work he had undertaken for King <name type="person">Solomon</name> in the temple of God:</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.12">the two pillars; the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars; the two sets of network decorating the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars;</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.13">the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of pomegranates for each network, decorating the bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars);</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.14">the stands with their basins;</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.15">the Sea and the twelve bulls under it;</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.16">the pots, shovels, meat forks and all related articles. All the objects that <name type="person">Huram-Abi</name> made for King <name type="person">Solomon</name> for the temple of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> were of polished bronze.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.17">The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the <name type="place">Jordan</name> between <name type="place">Sukkoth</name> and <name type="place">Zarethan</name>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.18">All these things <name type="person">Solomon</name> made amounted to so much that the weight of the bronze could not be determined.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.19"><name type="person">Solomon</name> also made all the furnishings that were in God's temple: the golden altar; the tables on which was the bread of the Presence;</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.20">the lampstands of pure gold with their lamps, to burn in front of the inner sanctuary as prescribed;</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.21">the gold floral work and lamps and tongs (they were solid gold);</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.22">the pure gold wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and censers; and the gold doors of the temple: the inner doors to the inner sanctuary and the doors of the main hall.</verse>

      <title type="section">The Ark Brought to the Temple</title>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.1">When all the work <name type="person">Solomon</name> had done for the temple of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> was finished, he brought in the things his father <name type="person">David</name> had dedicated—the silver and gold and all the furnishings—and he placed them in the treasuries of God's temple.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.2">Then <name type="person">Solomon</name> summoned to <name type="place">Jerusalem</name> the elders of <name type="place">Israel</name>, all the heads of the tribes and the chiefs of the Israelite families, to bring up the ark of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>'s covenant from <name type="place">Zion</name>, the City of <name type="person">David</name>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.3">And all the Israelites came together to the king at the time of the festival in the seventh month.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.4">When all the elders of <name type="place">Israel</name> had arrived, the <name type="people">Levites</name> took up the ark,</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.5">and they brought up the ark and the tent of meeting and all the furnishings set apart for God in it. The Levitical priests carried them up;</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.6">and King <name type="person">Solomon</name> and the entire assembly of <name type="place">Israel</name> that had gathered about him were before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they could not be recorded or counted.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.7">The priests then brought the ark of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>'s covenant to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the inner sanctuary, and put it beneath the wings of the cherubim.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.8">The cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and covered the ark and its carrying poles.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.9">These poles were so long that their ends, extending from the ark, could be seen from in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside the sanctuary; and they are still there today.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.10">There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets that <name type="person">Moses</name> had placed in it at <name type="place">Horeb</name>, where <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> made a covenant with the Israelites after they came out of <name type="place">Egypt</name>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.11">The priests then withdrew from the sanctuary. All the priests who were there had consecrated themselves, regardless of their divisions.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.12">All the <name type="people">Levites</name> who were musicians—<name type="person">Asaph</name>, <name type="person">Heman</name>, <name type="person">Jeduthun</name> and their sons and relatives—stood on the east side of the altar, dressed in fine linen and playing cymbals, harps and lyres. They were accompanied by 120 priests sounding trumpets.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.13">The trumpeters and musicians joined in unison to give praise and thanks to <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>. Accompanied by trumpets, cymbals and other instruments, the singers raised their voices in praise to <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> and sang: "He is good; his love endures forever." Then the temple of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> was filled with the cloud,</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.14">and the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud, for the glory of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> filled the temple of God.</verse>

      <verse osisID="2Chr.6.2">I have built a magnificent temple for you, a place for you to dwell forever."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.6.3">While the whole assembly of <name type="place">Israel</name> was standing there, the king turned around and blessed them.</verse>

      <verse osisID="2Chr.6.5">'Since the day I brought my people out of <name type="place">Egypt</name>, I have not chosen a city in any tribe of <name type="place">Israel</name> to have a temple built so that my Name might be there, nor have I chosen anyone to be ruler over my people <name type="place">Israel</name>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.6.6">But now I have chosen <name type="place">Jerusalem</name> for my Name to be there, and I have chosen <name type="person">David</name> to rule my people <name type="place">Israel</name>.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.6.7">My father <name type="person">David</name> had it in his heart to build a temple for the Name of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, the God of <name type="place">Israel</name>.</verse>

      <verse osisID="2Chr.6.12">Then <name type="person">Solomon</name> stood before the altar of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> in front of the whole assembly of <name type="place">Israel</name> and spread out his hands.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.6.13">Now he had made a bronze platform, five cubits long, five cubits wide and three cubits high, and had placed it in the center of the outer court. He stood on the platform and then knelt down before the whole assembly of <name type="place">Israel</name> and spread out his hands toward heaven.</verse>

      <verse osisID="2Chr.16.2"><name type="person">Asa</name> then took the silver and gold out of the treasuries of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>'s temple and of his own palace and sent it to <name type="person">Ben-Hadad</name> king of <name type="place">Aram</name>, who was ruling in <name type="place">Damascus</name>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.16.3">"Let there be a treaty between me and you," he said, "as there was between my father and your father. See, I am sending you silver and gold.

      <verse osisID="2Chr.16.4"><name type="person">Ben-Hadad</name> agreed with King <name type="person">Asa</name> and sent the commanders of his forces against the towns of <name type="place">Israel</name>.

      <verse osisID="2Chr.16.7">At that time <name type="person">Hanani</name> the seer came to <name type="person">Asa</name> king of <name type="place">Judah</name> and said to him: "Because you relied on the king of <name type="place">Aram</name> and not on <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> your God, the army of the king of <name type="place">Aram</name> has escaped from your hand.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.16.8">Were not the <name type="people">Cushites</name> and <name type="people">Libyans</name> a mighty army with great numbers of chariots and horsemen? Yet when you relied on <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, he delivered them into your hand.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.16.9">For the eyes of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him. You have done a foolish thing, and from now on you will be at war."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.16.10"><name type="person">Asa</name> was angry with the seer because of this; he was so enraged that he put him in prison. At the same time <name type="person">Asa</name> brutally oppressed some of the people.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.16.11">The events of <name type="person">Asa</name>'s reign, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the kings of <name type="place">Judah</name> and <name type="place">Israel</name>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.16.12">In the thirty-ninth year of his reign <name type="person">Asa</name> was afflicted with a disease in his feet. Though his disease was severe, even in his illness he did not seek help from <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, but only from the physicians.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.16.13">Then in the forty-first year of his reign <name type="person">Asa</name> died and rested with his ancestors.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.16.14">They buried him in the tomb that he had cut out for himself in the City of <name type="person">David</name>. They laid him on a bier covered with spices and various blended perfumes, and they made a huge fire in his honor.</verse>

      <verse osisID="2Chr.18.3"><name type="person">Ahab</name> king of <name type="place">Israel</name> asked <name type="person">Jehoshaphat</name> king of <name type="place">Judah</name>, "Will you go with me against <name type="place">Ramoth Gilead</name>?" <name type="person">Jehoshaphat</name> replied, "I am as you are, and my people as your people; we will join you in the war."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.18.4">But <name type="person">Jehoshaphat</name> also said to the king of <name type="place">Israel</name>, "First seek the counsel of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>."</verse>

      <verse osisID="2Chr.18.6">But <name type="person">Jehoshaphat</name> asked, "Is there no longer a prophet of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> here whom we can inquire of?"</verse>

      <verse osisID="2Chr.18.10">Now <name type="person">Zedekiah</name> son of <name type="person">Kenaanah</name> had made iron horns, and he declared, "This is what <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> says: 'With these you will gore the <name type="people">Arameans</name> until they are destroyed.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.18.11">All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing. "Attack <name type="place">Ramoth Gilead</name> and be victorious," they said, "for <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> will give it into the king's hand."</verse>

      <verse osisID="2Chr.18.13">But <name type="person">Micaiah</name> said, "As surely as <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> lives, I can tell him only what my God says."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.18.14">When he arrived, the king asked him, "<name type="person">Micaiah</name>, shall we go to war against <name type="place">Ramoth Gilead</name>, or shall I not?" "Attack and be victorious," he answered, "for they will be given into your hand."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.18.15">The king said to him, "How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.18.16">Then <name type="person">Micaiah</name> answered, "I saw all <name type="place">Israel</name> scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> said, 'These people have no master. Let each one go home in peace.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.18.17">The king of <name type="place">Israel</name> said to <name type="person">Jehoshaphat</name>, "Didn't I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad?"</verse>

      <verse osisID="2Chr.18.19">And <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> said, 'Who will entice <name type="person">Ahab</name> king of <name type="place">Israel</name> into attacking <name type="place">Ramoth Gilead</name> and going to his death there?' One suggested this, and another that.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.18.20">Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> and said, 'I will entice him.' 'By what means?' <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> asked.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.18.21">'I will go and be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,' he said. 'You will succeed in enticing him,' said <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>. 'Go and do it.'</verse>

      <verse osisID="2Chr.18.23">Then <name type="person">Zedekiah</name> son of <name type="person">Kenaanah</name> went up and slapped <name type="person">Micaiah</name> in the face.

      <verse osisID="2Chr.18.25">The king of <name type="place">Israel</name> then ordered, "Take <name type="person">Micaiah</name> and send him back to <name type="person">Amon</name> the ruler of the city and to <name type="person">Joash</name> the king's son,</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.18.26">and say, 'This is what the king says: Put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely.'"</verse>

      <verse osisID="2Chr.18.30">Now the king of <name type="place">Aram</name> had ordered his chariot commanders, "Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of <name type="place">Israel</name>."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.18.31">When the chariot commanders saw <name type="person">Jehoshaphat</name>, they thought, "This is the king of <name type="place">Israel</name>."

      <verse osisID="2Chr.18.32">for when the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of <name type="place">Israel</name>, they stopped pursuing him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.18.33">But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of <name type="place">Israel</name> between the sections of his armor. The king told the chariot driver, "Wheel around and get me out of the fighting. I've been wounded."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.18.34">All day long the battle raged, and the king of <name type="place">Israel</name> propped himself up in his chariot facing the <name type="people">Arameans</name> until evening. Then at sunset he died.</verse>

      <verse osisID="2Chr.32.4">They gathered a large group of people who blocked all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land. "Why should the kings of <name type="place">Assyria</name> come and find plenty of water?" they said.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.32.5">Then he worked hard repairing all the broken sections of the wall and building towers on it. He built another wall outside that one and reinforced the terraces of the City of <name type="person">David</name>. He also made large numbers of weapons and shields.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.32.6">He appointed military officers over the people and assembled them before him in the square at the city gate and encouraged them with these words:</verse>
