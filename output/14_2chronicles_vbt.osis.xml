      <title type="section">Solomon's Request for Wisdom</title>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.1"><name type="person">Solomon</name> son of <name type="person">David</name> established himself firmly in his kingdom, and <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> his God was with him and made him exceedingly great.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.2">Then <name type="person">Solomon</name> spoke to all <name type="place">Israel</name>—to the commanders of thousands and hundreds, to the judges and to every leader in all <name type="place">Israel</name>, the heads of families.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.3"><name type="person">Solomon</name> and the whole assembly went to the high place at <name type="place">Gibeon</name>, for God's tent of meeting was there, which <name type="person">Moses</name> the servant of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> had made in the wilderness.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.4">But <name type="person">David</name> had brought up the ark of God from <name type="place">Kiriath Jearim</name> to the place he had prepared for it, because he had pitched a tent for it in <name type="place">Jerusalem</name>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.5">But the bronze altar that <name type="person">Bezalel</name> son of <name type="person">Uri</name>, the son of <name type="person">Hur</name>, had made was in <name type="place">Gibeon</name> in front of the tabernacle of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>; so <name type="person">Solomon</name> and the assembly inquired of him there.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.6"><name type="person">Solomon</name> went up to the bronze altar before <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> in the tent of meeting and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.7">That night God appeared to <name type="person">Solomon</name> and said to him, "Ask for whatever you want me to give you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.8"><name type="person">Solomon</name> answered God, "You have shown great kindness to <name type="person">David</name> my father and have made me king in his place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.9">Now, <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> God, let your promise to my father <name type="person">David</name> be confirmed, for you have made me king over a people who are as numerous as the dust of the earth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.10">Give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may lead this people, for who is able to govern this great people of yours?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.11">God said to <name type="person">Solomon</name>, "Since this is your heart's desire and you have not asked for wealth, possessions or honor, nor for the death of your enemies, and since you have not asked for a long life but for wisdom and knowledge to govern my people over whom I have made you king,</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.12">therefore wisdom and knowledge will be given you. And I will also give you wealth, possessions and honor, such as no king who was before you ever had and none after you will have."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.13">Then <name type="person">Solomon</name> went to <name type="place">Jerusalem</name> from the high place at <name type="place">Gibeon</name>, from before the tent of meeting. And he reigned over <name type="place">Israel</name>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.14"><name type="person">Solomon</name> accumulated chariots and horses; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses, which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in <name type="place">Jerusalem</name>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.15">The king made silver and gold as common in <name type="place">Jerusalem</name> as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.16"><name type="person">Solomon</name>'s horses were imported from <name type="place">Egypt</name> and from <name type="place">Kue</name>—the royal merchants purchased them from <name type="place">Kue</name> at the current price.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.1.17">They imported a chariot from <name type="place">Egypt</name> for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. They also exported them to all the kings of the <name type="people">Hittites</name> and <name type="people">Arameans</name>.</verse>

      <title type="section">Preparations for Building the Temple</title>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.1"><name type="person">Solomon</name> gave orders to build a temple for the Name of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> and a royal palace for himself.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.2">He conscripted 70,000 men as carriers and 80,000 as stonecutters in the hills and 3,600 as supervisors over them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.3"><name type="person">Solomon</name> sent this message to <name type="person">Hiram</name> king of <name type="place">Tyre</name>: "As you dealt with my father <name type="person">David</name> and sent him cedar to build a palace to live in, now do the same for me.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.4">Now I am about to build a temple for the Name of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> my God and to dedicate it to him for burning fragrant incense before him, for setting out the consecrated bread regularly, and for making burnt offerings every morning and evening and on the Sabbaths, at the New Moons and at the appointed festivals of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> our God. This is a lasting ordinance for <name type="place">Israel</name>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.5">The temple I am going to build will be great, because our God is greater than all other gods.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.6">But who is able to build a temple for him, since the heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain him? Who then am I to build a temple for him, except as a place to burn sacrifices before him?</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.7">Send me, therefore, a man skilled to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, and in purple, crimson and blue yarn, and experienced in the art of engraving, to work in <name type="place">Judah</name> and <name type="place">Jerusalem</name> with my skilled workers, whom my father <name type="person">David</name> provided.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.8">Send me also cedar, juniper and algum logs from <name type="place">Lebanon</name>, for I know that your servants are skilled in cutting timber there. My servants will work with yours</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.9">to provide me with plenty of lumber, because the temple I build must be large and magnificent.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.10">I will give your servants, the woodcutters who cut the timber, twenty thousand cors of ground wheat, twenty thousand cors of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine and twenty thousand baths of olive oil."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.11"><name type="person">Hiram</name> king of <name type="place">Tyre</name> replied by letter to <name type="person">Solomon</name>: "Because <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> loves his people, he has made you their king."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.12">And <name type="person">Hiram</name> added: "Praise be to <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, the God of <name type="place">Israel</name>, who made heaven and earth! He has given King <name type="person">David</name> a wise son, endowed with intelligence and discernment, who will build a temple for <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> and a palace for himself.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.13">I am sending you <name type="person">Huram-Abi</name>, a man of great skill,</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.14">whose mother was from <name type="place">Dan</name> and whose father was from <name type="place">Tyre</name>. He is trained to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, stone and wood, and with purple and blue and crimson yarn and fine linen. He is experienced in all kinds of engraving and can execute any design given to him. He will work with your skilled workers and with those of my lord, <name type="person">David</name> your father.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.15">Now let my lord send his servants the wheat and barley and the olive oil and wine he promised,</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.16">and we will cut all the logs from <name type="place">Lebanon</name> that you need and will float them as rafts by sea down to <name type="place">Joppa</name>. You can then take them up to <name type="place">Jerusalem</name>."</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.17"><name type="person">Solomon</name> took a census of all the foreigners residing in <name type="place">Israel</name>, after the census his father <name type="person">David</name> had taken; and they were found to be 153,600.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.2.18">He assigned 70,000 of them to be carriers and 80,000 to be stonecutters in the hills, with 3,600 supervisors over them to keep the people working.</verse>

      <title type="section">Solomon Builds the Temple</title>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.1">Then <name type="person">Solomon</name> began to build the temple of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> in <name type="place">Jerusalem</name> on <name type="place">Mount Moriah</name>, where <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> had appeared to his father <name type="person">David</name>. It was on the threshing floor of <name type="person">Araunah</name> the <name type="people">Jebusite</name>, the place provided by <name type="person">David</name>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.2">He began building on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.3">The foundation <name type="person">Solomon</name> laid for building the temple of God was sixty cubits long and twenty cubits wide (using the cubit of the old standard).</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.4">The portico at the front of the temple was twenty cubits long across the width of the building and twenty cubits high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.5">He paneled the main hall with juniper and covered it with fine gold and decorated it with palm tree and chain designs.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.6">He adorned the temple with precious stones for beauty. And the gold he used was gold of <name type="place">Parvaim</name>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.7">He overlaid the ceiling beams, doorframes, walls and doors of the temple with gold, and he carved cherubim on the walls.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.8">He built the Most Holy Place, its length corresponding to the width of the temple—twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide. He overlaid the inside with six hundred talents of fine gold.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.9">The gold nails weighed fifty shekels. He also overlaid the upper parts with gold.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.10">For the Most Holy Place he made a pair of sculptured cherubim and overlaid them with gold.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.11">The total wingspan of the cherubim was twenty cubits. One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long and touched the temple wall, while its other wing, also five cubits long, touched the wing of the other cherub.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.12">Similarly, one wing of the second cherub was five cubits long and touched the other temple wall, and its other wing, also five cubits long, touched the wing of the first cherub.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.13">The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits. They stood on their feet, facing the main hall.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.14">He made the curtain of blue, purple and crimson yarn and fine linen, with cherubim worked into it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.15">For the front of the temple he made two pillars, which together were thirty-five cubits long, each with a capital five cubits high.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.16">He made interwoven chains and put them on top of the pillars. He also made a hundred pomegranates and attached them to the chains.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.3.17">He erected the pillars in the front of the temple, one to the south and one to the north. The one to the south he named <name type="place">Jakin</name> and the one to the north <name type="place">Boaz</name>.</verse>

      <title type="section">The Temple's Furnishings</title>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.1">He made a bronze altar twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide and ten cubits high.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.2">He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty cubits to measure around it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.3">Below the rim, figures of bulls encircled it—ten to a cubit. The bulls were cast in two rows in one piece with the Sea.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.4">The Sea stood on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were toward the center.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.5">It was a handbreadth thick, and its rim was like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held three thousand baths.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.6">He then made ten basins for washing and placed five on the south side and five on the north. In them the things to be used for the burnt offerings were rinsed, but the Sea was to be used by the priests for washing.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.7">He made ten gold lampstands according to the specifications for them and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.8">He made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north. He also made a hundred gold sprinkling bowls.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.9">He made the courtyard of the priests, and the large court and the doors for the court, and overlaid the doors with bronze.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.10">He placed the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.11">And <name type="person">Huram</name> also made the pots and shovels and sprinkling bowls. So <name type="person">Huram</name> finished the work he had undertaken for King <name type="person">Solomon</name> in the temple of God:</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.12">the two pillars; the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars; the two sets of network decorating the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars;</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.13">the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of pomegranates for each network, decorating the bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars);</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.14">the stands with their basins;</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.15">the Sea and the twelve bulls under it;</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.16">the pots, shovels, meat forks and all related articles. All the objects that <name type="person">Huram-Abi</name> made for King <name type="person">Solomon</name> for the temple of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> were of polished bronze.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.17">The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the <name type="place">Jordan</name> between <name type="place">Sukkoth</name> and <name type="place">Zarethan</name>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.18">All these things <name type="person">Solomon</name> made amounted to so much that the weight of the bronze could not be determined.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.19"><name type="person">Solomon</name> also made all the furnishings that were in God's temple: the golden altar; the tables on which was the bread of the Presence;</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.20">the lampstands of pure gold with their lamps, to burn in front of the inner sanctuary as prescribed;</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.21">the gold floral work and lamps and tongs (they were solid gold);</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.4.22">the pure gold wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and censers; and the gold doors of the temple: the inner doors to the Most Holy Place and the doors of the main hall.</verse>

      <title type="section">The Ark Brought to the Temple</title>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.1">When all the work <name type="person">Solomon</name> had done for the temple of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> was finished, he brought in the things his father <name type="person">David</name> had dedicated—the silver and gold and all the furnishings—and he placed them in the treasuries of God's temple.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.2">Then <name type="person">Solomon</name> summoned to <name type="place">Jerusalem</name> the elders of <name type="place">Israel</name>, all the heads of the tribes and the chiefs of the Israelite families, to bring up the ark of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>'s covenant from <name type="place">Zion</name>, the City of <name type="person">David</name>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.3">And all the Israelites came together to the king at the time of the festival in the seventh month.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.4">When all the elders of <name type="place">Israel</name> had arrived, the <name type="people">Levites</name> took up the ark,</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.5">and they brought up the ark and the tent of meeting and all the sacred furnishings in it. The Levitical priests carried them up;</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.6">and King <name type="person">Solomon</name> and the entire assembly of <name type="place">Israel</name> that had gathered about him were before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they could not be recorded or counted.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.7">The priests then brought the ark of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>'s covenant to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place, and put it beneath the wings of the cherubim.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.8">The cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and covered the ark and its carrying poles.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.9">These poles were so long that their ends, extending from the ark, could be seen from in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside the Holy Place; and they are still there today.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.10">There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets that <name type="person">Moses</name> had placed in it at <name type="place">Horeb</name>, where <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> made a covenant with the Israelites after they came out of <name type="place">Egypt</name>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.11">The priests then withdrew from the Holy Place. All the priests who were there had consecrated themselves, regardless of their divisions.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.12">All the <name type="people">Levites</name> who were musicians—<name type="person">Asaph</name>, <name type="person">Heman</name>, <name type="person">Jeduthun</name> and their sons and relatives—stood on the east side of the altar, dressed in fine linen and playing cymbals, harps and lyres. They were accompanied by 120 priests sounding trumpets.</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.13">The trumpeters and musicians joined in unison to give praise and thanks to <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>. Accompanied by trumpets, cymbals and other instruments, the singers raised their voices in praise to <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> and sang: "He is good; his love endures forever." Then the temple of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> was filled with the cloud,</verse>
      <verse osisID="2Chr.5.14">and the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud, for the glory of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> filled the temple of God.</verse>
