      <div type="introduction">
        <p>First Kings continues the history of Israel from the end of David's reign through the division of the kingdom. The book covers Solomon's wisdom and the building of the temple, but also his tragic turn to idolatry, which led to the kingdom splitting into Israel and Judah. It shows how the kings' faithfulness to God determined their success and their people's welfare.</p>

        <title type="chapter">Chapter 1</title>
        <title type="sub">David's Old Age and Adonijah's Rebellion</title>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.1">King David was old and well along in years. Though they covered him with blankets, he could not get warm.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.2">So his servants said to him, "Let us find a young virgin to serve the king and take care of him. She can lie beside you so that our lord the king may stay warm."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.3">Then they searched throughout all the territory of Israel for a beautiful young woman and found <name type="person">Abishag the Shunammite</name> and brought her to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.4">The woman was very beautiful; she took care of the king and served him, but the king did not have sexual relations with her.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.5">Now <name type="person">Adonijah son of Haggith</name> put himself forward and said, "I will be king." So he got chariots and horses ready, with fifty men to run ahead of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.6">(His father had never rebuked him by asking, "Why do you behave as you do?" He was also very handsome and was born next after <name type="person">Absalom</name>.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.7"><name type="person">Adonijah</name> conferred with <name type="person">Joab son of Zeruiah</name> and with <name type="person">Abiathar the priest</name>, and they gave him their support.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.8">But <name type="person">Zadok the priest</name>, <name type="person">Benaiah son of Jehoiada</name>, <name type="person">Nathan the prophet</name>, <name type="person">Shimei</name> and <name type="person">Rei</name> and David's special guard did not join <name type="person">Adonijah</name>.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.9"><name type="person">Adonijah</name> then sacrificed sheep, cattle and fattened calves at the <name type="geographic">Stone of Zoheleth</name> near <name type="geographic">En Rogel</name>. He invited all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the royal officials of <name type="geographic">Judah</name>,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.10">but he did not invite <name type="person">Nathan the prophet</name> or <name type="person">Benaiah</name> or the special guard or his brother <name type="person">Solomon</name>.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.11">Then <name type="person">Nathan</name> asked <name type="person">Bathsheba</name>, <name type="person">Solomon's</name> mother, "Haven't you heard that <name type="person">Adonijah son of Haggith</name> has become king, and our lord <name type="person">David</name> knows nothing about it?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.12">Now then, let me advise you how you can save your own life and the life of your son <name type="person">Solomon</name>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.13">Go in to King <name type="person">David</name> and say to him, 'My lord the king, did you not swear to me your servant: "Surely <name type="person">Solomon</name> your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne"? Why then has <name type="person">Adonijah</name> become king?'</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.14">While you are still there talking to the king, I will come in and add my words to what you have said."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.15">So <name type="person">Bathsheba</name> went to see the aged king in his room, where <name type="person">Abishag the Shunammite</name> was attending him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.16"><name type="person">Bathsheba</name> bowed down, prostrating herself before the king. "What is it you want?" the king asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.17">She said to him, "My lord, you yourself swore to me your servant by <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> your God: '<name type="person">Solomon</name> your son shall be king after me and will sit on my throne.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.18">But now <name type="person">Adonijah</name> has become king, and you, my lord the king, do not know about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.19">He has sacrificed great numbers of cattle, fattened calves, and sheep, and has invited all the king's sons, <name type="person">Abiathar the priest</name> and <name type="person">Joab the commander of the army</name>, but he has not invited <name type="person">Solomon</name> your servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.20">My lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, to learn from you who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.21">Otherwise, as soon as my lord the king is laid to rest with his ancestors, I and my son <name type="person">Solomon</name> will be treated as criminals."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.22">While she was still speaking with the king, <name type="person">Nathan the prophet</name> arrived.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.23">They told the king, "<name type="person">Nathan the prophet</name> is here." So he went before the king and bowed with his face to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.24"><name type="person">Nathan</name> said, "Have you, my lord the king, declared that <name type="person">Adonijah</name> shall be king after you, and that he will sit on your throne?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.25">Today he has gone down and sacrificed great numbers of cattle, fattened calves, and sheep. He has invited all the king's sons, the commanders of the army and <name type="person">Abiathar the priest</name>. Right now they are eating and drinking with him and saying, 'Long live King <name type="person">Adonijah</name>!'</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.26">But me your servant, and <name type="person">Zadok the priest</name>, and <name type="person">Benaiah son of Jehoiada</name>, and your servant <name type="person">Solomon</name> he did not invite.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.27">Is this something my lord the king has done without letting his servants know who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?"</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">David Declares Solomon King</title>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.28">Then King <name type="person">David</name> said, "Call in <name type="person">Bathsheba</name>." So she came into the king's presence and stood before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.29">The king then took an oath: "As surely as <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> lives, who has delivered me out of every trouble,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.30">I will surely carry out this very day what I swore to you by <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, the God of Israel: <name type="person">Solomon</name> your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne in my place."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.31">Then <name type="person">Bathsheba</name> bowed down with her face to the ground, prostrating herself before the king, and said, "May my lord King <name type="person">David</name> live forever!"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.32">King <name type="person">David</name> said, "Call in <name type="person">Zadok the priest</name>, <name type="person">Nathan the prophet</name> and <name type="person">Benaiah son of Jehoiada</name>." When they came before the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.33">he said to them: "Take your lord's servants with you and have <name type="person">Solomon</name> my son mount my own mule and take him down to <name type="geographic">Gihon</name>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.34">There have <name type="person">Zadok the priest</name> and <name type="person">Nathan the prophet</name> anoint him king over Israel. Blow the trumpet and shout, 'Long live King <name type="person">Solomon</name>!'</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.35">Then you are to go up with him, and he is to come and sit on my throne and reign in my place. I have appointed him ruler over Israel and <name type="geographic">Judah</name>."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.36"><name type="person">Benaiah son of Jehoiada</name> answered the king, "Amen! May <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, the God of my lord the king, so declare it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.37">As <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> was with my lord the king, so may he be with <name type="person">Solomon</name> to make his throne even greater than the throne of my lord King <name type="person">David</name>!"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.38">So <name type="person">Zadok the priest</name>, <name type="person">Nathan the prophet</name>, <name type="person">Benaiah son of Jehoiada</name>, the <name type="person">Kerethites</name> and the <name type="person">Pelethites</name> went down and had <name type="person">Solomon</name> mount King <name type="person">David's</name> mule, and they escorted him to <name type="geographic">Gihon</name>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.39"><name type="person">Zadok the priest</name> took the horn of oil from the sacred tent and had oil poured on <name type="person">Solomon</name>. Then they sounded the trumpet and all the people shouted, "Long live King <name type="person">Solomon</name>!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.40">And all the people went up after him, playing pipes and rejoicing greatly, so that the ground shook with the sound.<note type="background">Playing flutes was standard celebration music.</note></verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.41"><name type="person">Adonijah</name> and all the guests who were with him heard it as they were finishing their feast. On hearing the sound of the trumpet, <name type="person">Joab</name> asked, "What's the meaning of all the noise in the city?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.42">Even as he was speaking, <name type="person">Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest</name> arrived. <name type="person">Adonijah</name> said, "Come in. A worthy man like you must be bringing good news."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.43">"Not at all!" <name type="person">Jonathan</name> answered. "Our lord King <name type="person">David</name> has made <name type="person">Solomon</name> king.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.44">The king has sent with him <name type="person">Zadok the priest</name>, <name type="person">Nathan the prophet</name>, <name type="person">Benaiah son of Jehoiada</name>, the <name type="person">Kerethites</name> and the <name type="person">Pelethites</name>, and they have put him on the king's mule,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.45">and <name type="person">Zadok the priest</name> and <name type="person">Nathan the prophet</name> have had oil poured on him as king at <name type="geographic">Gihon</name>. From there they have gone up cheering, and the city resounds with it. That's the noise you hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.46">Moreover, <name type="person">Solomon</name> has taken his seat on the royal throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.47">Also, the royal officials have come to congratulate our lord King <name type="person">David</name>, saying, 'May your God make <name type="person">Solomon's</name> name more famous than yours and his throne greater than yours!' And the king bowed in worship on his bed</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.48">and said, 'Praise be to <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, the God of Israel, who has allowed my eyes to see a successor sit on my throne today.'"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.49">At this, all <name type="person">Adonijah's</name> guests rose in alarm and dispersed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.50">But <name type="person">Adonijah</name>, in fear of <name type="person">Solomon</name>, went and took hold of the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.51">Then <name type="person">Solomon</name> was told, "<name type="person">Adonijah</name> is afraid of King <name type="person">Solomon</name> and is clinging to the horns of the altar. He says, 'Let King <name type="person">Solomon</name> swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.52"><name type="person">Solomon</name> replied, "If he shows himself to be worthy, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground; but if evil is found in him, he will die."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.53">Then King <name type="person">Solomon</name> sent men, and they brought him down from the altar. And <name type="person">Adonijah</name> came and bowed down to King <name type="person">Solomon</name>, and <name type="person">Solomon</name> said, "Go to your home."</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Kgs.2">
        <title type="chapter">Chapter 2</title>
        <title type="sub">David's Final Instructions and Death</title>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.1">When <name type="person">David's</name> time to die drew near, he gave these commands to his son <name type="person">Solomon</name>:</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.2">"I am about to go the way of all the earth. So be strong, act like a man,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.3">and observe what <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> your God requires: Walk in obedience to him, and keep his decrees and commands, his laws and regulations, as written in the Law of <name type="person">Moses</name>. Do this so that you may prosper in all you do and wherever you go</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.4">and that <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> may keep his promise to me: 'If your descendants watch how they live, and if they walk faithfully before me with all their heart and soul, you will never fail to have a successor on the throne of Israel.'"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.5">"Now you yourself know what <name type="person">Joab son of Zeruiah</name> did to me—what he did to the two commanders of Israel's armies, <name type="person">Abner son of Ner</name> and <name type="person">Amasa son of Jether</name>. He killed them, shedding their blood in peacetime as if in battle, and with that blood he stained the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.6">Deal with him according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to the grave in peace.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.7">"But show kindness to the sons of <name type="person">Barzillai the Gileadite</name> and let them be among those who eat at your table. They stood by me when I fled from your brother <name type="person">Absalom</name>.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.8">"And remember, you have with you <name type="person">Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim</name>, who called down bitter curses on me the day I went to <name type="geographic">Mahanaim</name>. When he came down to meet me at the <name type="geographic">Jordan</name>, I swore to him by <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>: 'I will not put you to death by the sword.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.9">But now, do not consider him innocent. You are a wise man; you will know what to do to him. Bring his gray head down to the grave in blood."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.10">Then <name type="person">David</name> rested with his ancestors and was buried in the <name type="geographic">City of David</name>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.11">He had reigned forty years over Israel—seven years in <name type="geographic">Hebron</name> and thirty-three in <name type="geographic">Jerusalem</name>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.12">So <name type="person">Solomon</name> sat on the throne of his father <name type="person">David</name>, and his rule was firmly established.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">Adonijah's Request and Execution</title>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.13">Now <name type="person">Adonijah son of Haggith</name> went to <name type="person">Bathsheba</name>, <name type="person">Solomon's</name> mother. <name type="person">Bathsheba</name> asked him, "Do you come peacefully?" He answered, "Yes, peacefully."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.14">Then he added, "I have something to say to you." "You may say it," she replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.15">"As you know," he said, "the kingdom was mine. All Israel looked to me as their king. But things changed, and the kingdom has gone to my brother; for it has come to him from <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.16">Now I have one request to make of you. Do not refuse me." "You may make it," she said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.17">So he continued, "Please ask King <name type="person">Solomon</name>—he will not refuse you—to give me <name type="person">Abishag the Shunammite</name> as my wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.18">"Very well," <name type="person">Bathsheba</name> replied, "I will speak to the king for you."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.19">When <name type="person">Bathsheba</name> went to King <name type="person">Solomon</name> to speak to him for <name type="person">Adonijah</name>, the king stood up to meet her, bowed down to her and sat down on his throne. He had a throne brought for the king's mother, and she sat down at his right hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.20">"I have one small request to make of you," she said. "Do not refuse me." The king replied, "Make it, my mother; I will not refuse you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.21">So she said, "Let <name type="person">Abishag the Shunammite</name> be given in marriage to your brother <name type="person">Adonijah</name>."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.22">King <name type="person">Solomon</name> answered his mother, "Why do you request <name type="person">Abishag the Shunammite</name> for <name type="person">Adonijah</name>? You might as well request the kingdom for him—after all, he is my older brother—yes, for him and for <name type="person">Abiathar the priest</name> and <name type="person">Joab son of Zeruiah</name>!"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.23">Then King <name type="person">Solomon</name> swore by <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>: "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if <name type="person">Adonijah</name> does not pay with his life for this request!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.24">And now, as surely as <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> lives—he who has established me securely on the throne of my father <name type="person">David</name> and has founded a dynasty for me as he promised—<name type="person">Adonijah</name> shall be put to death today!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.25">So King <name type="person">Solomon</name> gave orders to <name type="person">Benaiah son of Jehoiada</name>, and he struck down <name type="person">Adonijah</name> and he died.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">Abiathar Banished and Joab Killed</title>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.26">To <name type="person">Abiathar the priest</name> the king said, "Go back to your fields in <name type="geographic">Anathoth</name>. You deserve to die, but I will not put you to death now, because you carried the ark of the Sovereign <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> before <name type="person">David</name> my father and shared all my father's hardships."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.27">So <name type="person">Solomon</name> banished <name type="person">Abiathar</name> from the priesthood of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, fulfilling the word <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> had spoken at <name type="geographic">Shiloh</name> about the house of <name type="person">Eli</name>.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.28">When the news reached <name type="person">Joab</name>, who had conspired with <name type="person">Adonijah</name> though not with <name type="person">Absalom</name>, he fled to the tent of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> and took hold of the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.29">King <name type="person">Solomon</name> was told that <name type="person">Joab</name> had fled to the tent of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> and was beside the altar. Then <name type="person">Solomon</name> ordered <name type="person">Benaiah son of Jehoiada</name>, "Go, strike him down!"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.30">So <name type="person">Benaiah</name> entered the tent of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> and said to <name type="person">Joab</name>, "The king says, 'Come out!'" But he answered, "No, I will die here." <name type="person">Benaiah</name> reported to the king, "<name type="person">Joab</name> said this, and this is how he answered me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.31">Then the king commanded <name type="person">Benaiah</name>, "Do as he says. Strike him down and bury him, and so clear me and my whole family of the guilt of the innocent blood that <name type="person">Joab</name> shed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.32"><divineName>Yahweh</divineName> will repay him for the blood he shed, because without my father <name type="person">David's</name> knowledge he attacked two men and killed them with the sword. Both of them—<name type="person">Abner son of Ner</name>, commander of Israel's army, and <name type="person">Amasa son of Jether</name>, commander of Judah's army—were better men and more upright than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.33">May the guilt of their blood rest on the head of <name type="person">Joab</name> and his descendants forever.

        <title type="sub">Solomon Builds the Temple</title>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.1">In the four hundred and eightieth year after the Israelites came out of <name type="geographic">Egypt</name>, in the fourth year of <name type="person">Solomon's</name> reign over Israel, in the month of <name type="person">Ziv</name>, the second month, he began to build the temple of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.2">The temple that King <name type="person">Solomon</name> built for <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> was sixty cubits long, twenty cubits wide and thirty cubits high.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.3">The portico at the front of the main hall of the temple extended the width of the temple, that is twenty cubits, and projected ten cubits from the front of the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.4">He made narrow windows high up in the temple walls.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.5">Against the walls of the main hall and inner sanctuary he built a structure around the building, in which there were side rooms.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.6">The lowest floor was five cubits wide, the middle floor six cubits and the third floor seven. He made offset ledges around the outside of the temple so that nothing would be inserted into the temple walls.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.7">In building the temple, only blocks dressed at the quarry were used, and no hammer, chisel or any iron tool was heard at the temple site while it was being built.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.8">The entrance to the lowest floor was on the south side of the temple; a stairway led up to the middle level and from there to the third.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.9">So he built the temple and completed it, roofing it with beams and cedar planks.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.10">And he built the side rooms all along the temple. The height of each was five cubits, and they were attached to the temple by beams of cedar.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.11">The word of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> came to <name type="person">Solomon</name>:</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.12">"As for this temple you are building, if you follow my decrees, observe my laws and keep all my commands and obey them, I will fulfill through you the promise I gave to <name type="person">David</name> your father.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.13">And I will live among the Israelites and will not abandon my people Israel."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.14">So <name type="person">Solomon</name> built the temple and completed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.15">He lined its interior walls with cedar boards, paneling them from the floor of the temple to the ceiling, and covered the floor of the temple with planks of juniper.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.16">He partitioned off twenty cubits at the rear of the temple with cedar boards from floor to ceiling to form within the temple an inner sanctuary, the inner sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.17">The main hall in front of this room was forty cubits long.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.18">The inside of the temple was cedar, carved with gourds and open flowers. Everything was cedar; no stone was to be seen.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.19">He prepared the inner sanctuary within the temple to set the ark of the covenant of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.20">The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide and twenty cubits high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold, and he also overlaid the altar of cedar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.21"><name type="person">Solomon</name> covered the inside of the temple with pure gold, and he extended gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary, which was overlaid with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.22">So he overlaid the whole interior with gold. He also overlaid with gold the altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">The Cherubim</title>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.23">For the inner sanctuary he made a pair of cherubim out of olive wood, each ten cubits high.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.24">One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long, and the other wing five cubits—ten cubits from wing tip to wing tip.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.25">The second cherub also measured ten cubits, for the two cherubim were identical in size and shape.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.26">The height of each cherub was ten cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.27">He placed the cherubim inside the innermost room of the temple, with their wings spread out. The wing of one cherub touched one wall, while the wing of the other touched the other wall, and their wings touched each other in the middle of the room.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.28">He overlaid the cherubim with gold.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.29">On the walls all around the temple, in both the inner and outer rooms, he carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.30">He also covered the floors of both the inner and outer rooms of the temple with gold.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.31">For the entrance to the inner sanctuary he made doors out of olive wood that were one-fifth of the width of the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.32">And on the two olive wood doors he carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid the cherubim and palm trees with hammered gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.33">In the same way, for the entrance to the main hall he made doorframes out of olive wood that were one-fourth of the width of the hall.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.34">He also made two doors out of juniper wood, each having two leaves that turned in sockets.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.35">He carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers on them and overlaid them with gold hammered evenly over the carvings.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.36">And he built the inner courtyard of three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed cedar beams.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.37">The foundation of the temple of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> was laid in the fourth year, in the month of <name type="person">Ziv</name>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.6.38">In the eleventh year in the month of <name type="person">Bul</name>, the eighth month, the temple was finished in all its details according to its specifications. He had spent seven years building it.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.1">It took <name type="person">Solomon</name> thirteen years, however, to complete the construction of his palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.2">He built the <name type="geographic">Palace of the Forest of Lebanon</name> a hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high, with four rows of cedar columns supporting trimmed cedar beams.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.3">It was roofed with cedar above the beams that rested on the columns—forty-five beams, fifteen to a row.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.4">Its windows were placed high in sets of three, facing each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.5">All the doorways had rectangular frames; they were in the front part in sets of three, facing each other.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.6">He made a colonnade fifty cubits long and thirty cubits wide. In front of it was a portico, and in front of that were pillars and an overhanging roof.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.7">He built the throne hall, the <name type="geographic">Hall of Justice</name>, where he was to judge, and he covered it with cedar from floor to ceiling.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.8">And the palace in which he was to live, set farther back, was similar in design. <name type="person">Solomon</name> also made a palace like this hall for <name type="person">Pharaoh's daughter</name>, whom he had married.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.9">All these structures, from the outside to the great courtyard and from foundation to eaves, were made of blocks of high-grade stone cut to size and smoothed with a saw on their inner and outer faces.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.10">The foundations were laid with large stones of good quality, some measuring ten cubits and some eight.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.11">Above were high-grade stones, cut to size, and cedar beams.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.12">The great courtyard was surrounded by a wall of three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed cedar beams, as was the inner courtyard of the temple of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> with its portico.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">The Temple's Furnishings</title>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.13">King <name type="person">Solomon</name> sent to <name type="geographic">Tyre</name> and brought <name type="person">Huram</name>,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.14">whose mother was a widow from the tribe of <name type="person">Naphtali</name> and whose father was from <name type="geographic">Tyre</name> and a skilled craftsman in bronze. <name type="person">Huram</name> was filled with wisdom, with understanding and with knowledge to do all kinds of bronze work. He came to King <name type="person">Solomon</name> and did all the work assigned to him.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">The Two Bronze Pillars</title>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.15">He cast two bronze pillars, each eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.16">He also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on the tops of the pillars; each capital was five cubits high.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.17">A network of interwoven chains adorned the capitals on top of the pillars, seven for each capital.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.18">He made pomegranates in two rows encircling each network to decorate the capitals on top of the pillars. He did the same for each capital.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.19">The capitals on top of the pillars in the portico were in the shape of lilies, four cubits high.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.20">On the capitals of both pillars, above the bowl-shaped part next to the network, were the two hundred pomegranates in rows all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.21">He erected the pillars at the portico of the temple. The pillar to the south he named <name type="person">Jakin</name> and the one to the north <name type="person">Boaz</name>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.22">The capitals on top were in the shape of lilies. And so the work on the pillars was completed.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">The Bronze Sea</title>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.23">He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty cubits to measure around it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.24">Below the rim, gourds encircled it—ten to a cubit. The gourds were cast in two rows in one piece with the Sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.25">The Sea stood on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were toward the center.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.26">It was a handbreadth in thickness, and its rim was like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held two thousand baths.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">The Ten Bronze Stands</title>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.27">He also made ten movable stands of bronze; each was four cubits long, four cubits wide and three cubits high.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.28">This is how the stands were made: They had side panels attached to uprights.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.29">On the panels between the uprights were lions, bulls and cherubim—and on the uprights as well. Above and below the lions and bulls were hammered decorations.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.30">Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles, and each had a basin resting on four supports, cast with decorations on each side.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.31">On the inside of the stand there was an opening that had a circular frame one cubit deep. This opening was round, and with its basework it measured a cubit and a half. Around its opening there was engraving. The panels of the stands were square, not round.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.32">The four wheels were under the panels, and the axles of the wheels were attached to the stand. The diameter of each wheel was a cubit and a half.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.33">The wheels were made like chariot wheels; the axles, rims, spokes and hubs were all of cast metal.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.34">Each stand had four handles, one on each corner, projecting from the stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.35">At the top of the stand there was a circular band half a cubit deep. The supports and panels were attached to the top of the stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.36">He engraved cherubim, lions and palm trees on the surfaces of the supports and on the panels, in every available space, with decorations all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.37">This is the way he made the ten stands. They were all cast in the same molds and were identical in size and shape.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.38">He then made ten bronze basins, each holding forty baths and measuring four cubits across, one basin for each of the ten stands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.39">He placed five of the stands on the south side of the temple and five on the north. He placed the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner of the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.40">He also made the pots and shovels and sprinkling bowls.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">Summary of Temple Furnishings</title>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.41">So <name type="person">Huram</name> finished all the work he had undertaken for King <name type="person">Solomon</name> in the temple of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>:</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.47">The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the <name type="geographic">Jordan</name> between <name type="geographic">Sukkoth</name> and <name type="geographic">Zarethan</name>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.48"><name type="person">Solomon</name> left all these articles unweighed, because there were so many; the weight of the bronze was not determined.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.49"><name type="person">Solomon</name> also made all the furnishings that were in <divineName>Yahweh's</divineName> temple: the golden altar; the golden table on which was the bread of the Presence;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.50">the lampstands of pure gold (five on the right and five on the left, in front of the inner sanctuary); the gold floral work and lamps and tongs;</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.7.51">the pure gold basins, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and censers; and the gold sockets for the doors of the innermost room, the inner sanctuary, and also for the doors of the main hall of the temple. When all the work King <name type="person">Solomon</name> had done for the temple of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> was finished, he brought in the things his father <name type="person">David</name> had dedicated—the silver and gold and the furnishings—and he placed them in the treasuries of <divineName>Yahweh's</divineName> temple.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Kgs.8.6">The priests then brought the ark of <divineName>Yahweh's</divineName> covenant to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the inner sanctuary, and put it beneath the wings of the cherubim.</verse>

        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.1">For three years there was no war between <name type="geographic">Aram</name> and Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.2">But in the third year <name type="person">Jehoshaphat king of Judah</name> went down to see the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.3">The king of Israel had said to his officials, "Don't you know that <name type="geographic">Ramoth Gilead</name> belongs to us and yet we are doing nothing to retake it from the king of <name type="geographic">Aram</name>?"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.4">So he asked <name type="person">Jehoshaphat</name>, "Will you go with me to fight against <name type="geographic">Ramoth Gilead</name>?" <name type="person">Jehoshaphat</name> replied to the king of Israel, "I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.5">But <name type="person">Jehoshaphat</name> also said to the king of Israel, "First seek the counsel of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.6">So the king of Israel brought together the prophets—about four hundred men—and asked them, "Shall I go to war against <name type="geographic">Ramoth Gilead</name>, or shall I refrain?" "Go," they answered, "for the Lord will give it into the king's hand."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.7">But <name type="person">Jehoshaphat</name> asked, "Is there no prophet of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> here whom we can inquire of?"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.8">The king of Israel answered <name type="person">Jehoshaphat</name>, "There is still one prophet through whom we can inquire of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me, but always bad. He is <name type="person">Micaiah son of Imlah</name>." "The king should not say such a thing," <name type="person">Jehoshaphat</name> replied.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.9">So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, "Bring <name type="person">Micaiah son of Imlah</name> at once."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.10">Dressed in their royal robes, the king of Israel and <name type="person">Jehoshaphat king of Judah</name> were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of <name type="geographic">Samaria</name>, with all the prophets prophesying before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.11">Now <name type="person">Zedekiah son of Kenaanah</name> had made iron horns and he declared, "This is what <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> says: 'With these you will gore the <name type="person">Arameans</name> until they are destroyed.'"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.12">All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing. "Attack <name type="geographic">Ramoth Gilead</name> and be victorious," they said, "for <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> will give it into the king's hand."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.13">The messenger who had gone to summon <name type="person">Micaiah</name> said to him, "Look, the other prophets without exception are predicting success for the king. Let your word agree with theirs, and speak favorably."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.14">But <name type="person">Micaiah</name> said, "As surely as <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> lives, I can tell him only what <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> tells me."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.15">When he arrived, the king asked him, "<name type="person">Micaiah</name>, shall we go to war against <name type="geographic">Ramoth Gilead</name>, or not?" "Attack and be victorious," he answered, "for <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> will give it into the king's hand."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.16">The king said to him, "How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>?"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.17">Then <name type="person">Micaiah</name> answered, "I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> said, 'These people have no master. Let each one go home in peace.'"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.18">The king of Israel said to <name type="person">Jehoshaphat</name>, "Didn't I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad?"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.19"><name type="person">Micaiah</name> continued, "Therefore hear the word of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>: I saw <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> sitting on his throne with all the multitudes of heaven standing around him on his right and on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.20">And <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> said, 'Who will entice <name type="person">Ahab</name> into attacking <name type="geographic">Ramoth Gilead</name> and going to his death there?' One suggested this, and another that.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.21">Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> and said, 'I will entice him.'</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.22">"'By what means?' <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> asked. "'I will go out and be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,' he said. "'You will succeed in enticing him,' said <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>. 'Go and do it.'</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.23">"So now <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> has put a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours. <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> has decreed disaster for you."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.24">Then <name type="person">Zedekiah son of Kenaanah</name> went up and slapped <name type="person">Micaiah</name> in the face. "Which way did the spirit from <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> go when he went from me to speak to you?" he asked.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.25"><name type="person">Micaiah</name> replied, "You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.26">The king of Israel then ordered, "Take <name type="person">Micaiah</name> and send him back to <name type="person">Amon the ruler of the city</name> and to <name type="person">Joash the king's son</name></verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.27">and say, 'This is what the king says: Put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely.'"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.28"><name type="person">Micaiah</name> declared, "If you ever return safely, <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> has not spoken through me." Then he added, "Mark my words, all you people!"</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">Ahab Killed at Ramoth Gilead</title>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.29">So the king of Israel and <name type="person">Jehoshaphat king of Judah</name> went up to <name type="geographic">Ramoth Gilead</name>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.30">The king of Israel said to <name type="person">Jehoshaphat</name>, "I will enter the battle in disguise, but you wear your royal robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.31">Now the king of <name type="geographic">Aram</name> had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders, "Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.32">When the chariot commanders saw <name type="person">Jehoshaphat</name>, they thought, "Surely this is the king of Israel." So they turned to attack him, but when <name type="person">Jehoshaphat</name> cried out,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.33">the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel and stopped pursuing him.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.34">But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the sections of his armor. The king told his chariot driver, "Wheel around and get me out of the fighting. I've been wounded."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.35">All day long the battle raged, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the <name type="person">Arameans</name>. The blood from his wound ran onto the floor of the chariot, and that evening he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.36">As the sun was setting, a cry spread through the army: "Every man to his town. Every man to his land!"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.37">So the king died and was brought to <name type="geographic">Samaria</name>, and they buried him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.38">They washed the chariot at a pool in <name type="geographic">Samaria</name> (where the prostitutes bathed), and the dogs licked up his blood, as the word of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> had declared.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.22.39">As for the other events of <name type="person">Ahab's</name> reign, including all he did, the palace he built and adorned with ivory, and the cities he fortified, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?</verse>
