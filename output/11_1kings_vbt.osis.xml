        <title type="sub">David's Old Age and Adonijah's Rebellion</title>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.1">King David was old and well along in years. Though they covered him with blankets, he could not get warm.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.2">So his servants said to him, "Let us find a young virgin to serve the king and take care of him. She can lie beside you so that our lord the king may stay warm."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.3">Then they searched throughout all the territory of Israel for a beautiful young woman and found <name type="person">Abishag the Shunammite</name> and brought her to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.4">The woman was very beautiful; she took care of the king and served him, but the king did not have sexual relations with her.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.5">Now <name type="person">Adonijah son of Haggith</name> put himself forward and said, "I will be king." So he got chariots and horses ready, with fifty men to run ahead of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.6">(His father had never rebuked him by asking, "Why do you behave as you do?" He was also very handsome and was born next after <name type="person">Absalom</name>.)</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.7"><name type="person">Adonijah</name> conferred with <name type="person">Joab son of Zeruiah</name> and with <name type="person">Abiathar the priest</name>, and they gave him their support.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.8">But <name type="person">Zadok the priest</name>, <name type="person">Benaiah son of Jehoiada</name>, <name type="person">Nathan the prophet</name>, <name type="person">Shimei</name> and <name type="person">Rei</name> and David's special guard did not join <name type="person">Adonijah</name>.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.9"><name type="person">Adonijah</name> then sacrificed sheep, cattle and fattened calves at the <name type="geographic">Stone of Zoheleth</name> near <name type="geographic">En Rogel</name>. He invited all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the royal officials of <name type="geographic">Judah</name>,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.10">but he did not invite <name type="person">Nathan the prophet</name> or <name type="person">Benaiah</name> or the special guard or his brother <name type="person">Solomon</name>.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.11">Then <name type="person">Nathan</name> asked <name type="person">Bathsheba</name>, <name type="person">Solomon's</name> mother, "Haven't you heard that <name type="person">Adonijah son of Haggith</name> has become king, and our lord <name type="person">David</name> knows nothing about it?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.12">Now then, let me advise you how you can save your own life and the life of your son <name type="person">Solomon</name>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.13">Go in to King <name type="person">David</name> and say to him, 'My lord the king, did you not swear to me your servant: "Surely <name type="person">Solomon</name> your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne"? Why then has <name type="person">Adonijah</name> become king?'</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.14">While you are still there talking to the king, I will come in and add my words to what you have said."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.15">So <name type="person">Bathsheba</name> went to see the aged king in his room, where <name type="person">Abishag the Shunammite</name> was attending him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.16"><name type="person">Bathsheba</name> bowed down, prostrating herself before the king. "What is it you want?" the king asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.17">She said to him, "My lord, you yourself swore to me your servant by <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> your God: '<name type="person">Solomon</name> your son shall be king after me and will sit on my throne.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.18">But now <name type="person">Adonijah</name> has become king, and you, my lord the king, do not know about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.19">He has sacrificed great numbers of cattle, fattened calves, and sheep, and has invited all the king's sons, <name type="person">Abiathar the priest</name> and <name type="person">Joab the commander of the army</name>, but he has not invited <name type="person">Solomon</name> your servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.20">My lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, to learn from you who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.21">Otherwise, as soon as my lord the king is laid to rest with his ancestors, I and my son <name type="person">Solomon</name> will be treated as criminals."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.22">While she was still speaking with the king, <name type="person">Nathan the prophet</name> arrived.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.23">They told the king, "<name type="person">Nathan the prophet</name> is here." So he went before the king and bowed with his face to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.24"><name type="person">Nathan</name> said, "Have you, my lord the king, declared that <name type="person">Adonijah</name> shall be king after you, and that he will sit on your throne?</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.25">Today he has gone down and sacrificed great numbers of cattle, fattened calves, and sheep. He has invited all the king's sons, the commanders of the army and <name type="person">Abiathar the priest</name>. Right now they are eating and drinking with him and saying, 'Long live King <name type="person">Adonijah</name>!'</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.26">But me your servant, and <name type="person">Zadok the priest</name>, and <name type="person">Benaiah son of Jehoiada</name>, and your servant <name type="person">Solomon</name> he did not invite.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.27">Is this something my lord the king has done without letting his servants know who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?"</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">David Declares Solomon King</title>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.28">Then King <name type="person">David</name> said, "Call in <name type="person">Bathsheba</name>." So she came into the king's presence and stood before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.29">The king then took an oath: "As surely as <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> lives, who has delivered me out of every trouble,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.30">I will surely carry out this very day what I swore to you by <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, the God of Israel: <name type="person">Solomon</name> your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne in my place."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.31">Then <name type="person">Bathsheba</name> bowed down with her face to the ground, prostrating herself before the king, and said, "May my lord King <name type="person">David</name> live forever!"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.32">King <name type="person">David</name> said, "Call in <name type="person">Zadok the priest</name>, <name type="person">Nathan the prophet</name> and <name type="person">Benaiah son of Jehoiada</name>." When they came before the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.33">he said to them: "Take your lord's servants with you and have <name type="person">Solomon</name> my son mount my own mule and take him down to <name type="geographic">Gihon</name>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.34">There have <name type="person">Zadok the priest</name> and <name type="person">Nathan the prophet</name> anoint him king over Israel. Blow the trumpet and shout, 'Long live King <name type="person">Solomon</name>!'</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.35">Then you are to go up with him, and he is to come and sit on my throne and reign in my place. I have appointed him ruler over Israel and <name type="geographic">Judah</name>."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.36"><name type="person">Benaiah son of Jehoiada</name> answered the king, "Amen! May <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, the God of my lord the king, so declare it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.37">As <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> was with my lord the king, so may he be with <name type="person">Solomon</name> to make his throne even greater than the throne of my lord King <name type="person">David</name>!"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.38">So <name type="person">Zadok the priest</name>, <name type="person">Nathan the prophet</name>, <name type="person">Benaiah son of Jehoiada</name>, the <name type="group">Kerethites</name> and the <name type="group">Pelethites</name> went down and had <name type="person">Solomon</name> mount King <name type="person">David's</name> mule, and they escorted him to <name type="geographic">Gihon</name>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.39"><name type="person">Zadok the priest</name> took the horn of oil from the sacred tent and anointed <name type="person">Solomon</name>. Then they sounded the trumpet and all the people shouted, "Long live King <name type="person">Solomon</name>!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.40">And all the people went up after him, playing pipes and rejoicing greatly, so that the ground shook with the sound.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.41"><name type="person">Adonijah</name> and all the guests who were with him heard it as they were finishing their feast. On hearing the sound of the trumpet, <name type="person">Joab</name> asked, "What's the meaning of all the noise in the city?"</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.42">Even as he was speaking, <name type="person">Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest</name> arrived. <name type="person">Adonijah</name> said, "Come in. A worthy man like you must be bringing good news."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.43">"Not at all!" <name type="person">Jonathan</name> answered. "Our lord King <name type="person">David</name> has made <name type="person">Solomon</name> king.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.44">The king has sent with him <name type="person">Zadok the priest</name>, <name type="person">Nathan the prophet</name>, <name type="person">Benaiah son of Jehoiada</name>, the <name type="group">Kerethites</name> and the <name type="group">Pelethites</name>, and they have put him on the king's mule,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.45">and <name type="person">Zadok the priest</name> and <name type="person">Nathan the prophet</name> have anointed him king at <name type="geographic">Gihon</name>. From there they have gone up cheering, and the city resounds with it. That's the noise you hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.46">Moreover, <name type="person">Solomon</name> has taken his seat on the royal throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.47">Also, the royal officials have come to congratulate our lord King <name type="person">David</name>, saying, 'May your God make <name type="person">Solomon's</name> name more famous than yours and his throne greater than yours!' And the king bowed in worship on his bed</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.48">and said, 'Praise be to <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, the God of Israel, who has allowed my eyes to see a successor sit on my throne today.'"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.49">At this, all <name type="person">Adonijah's</name> guests rose in alarm and dispersed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.50">But <name type="person">Adonijah</name>, in fear of <name type="person">Solomon</name>, went and took hold of the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.51">Then <name type="person">Solomon</name> was told, "<name type="person">Adonijah</name> is afraid of King <name type="person">Solomon</name> and is clinging to the horns of the altar. He says, 'Let King <name type="person">Solomon</name> swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.52"><name type="person">Solomon</name> replied, "If he shows himself to be worthy, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground; but if evil is found in him, he will die."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.1.53">Then King <name type="person">Solomon</name> sent men, and they brought him down from the altar. And <name type="person">Adonijah</name> came and bowed down to King <name type="person">Solomon</name>, and <name type="person">Solomon</name> said, "Go to your home."</verse>

      <chapter osisID="1Kgs.2">
        <title type="chapter">Chapter 2</title>
        <title type="sub">David's Final Instructions and Death</title>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.1">When <name type="person">David's</name> time to die drew near, he gave these commands to his son <name type="person">Solomon</name>:</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.2">"I am about to go the way of all the earth. So be strong, act like a man,</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.3">and observe what <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> your God requires: Walk in obedience to him, and keep his decrees and commands, his laws and regulations, as written in the Law of <name type="person">Moses</name>. Do this so that you may prosper in all you do and wherever you go</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.4">and that <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> may keep his promise to me: 'If your descendants watch how they live, and if they walk faithfully before me with all their heart and soul, you will never fail to have a successor on the throne of Israel.'"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.5">"Now you yourself know what <name type="person">Joab son of Zeruiah</name> did to me—what he did to the two commanders of Israel's armies, <name type="person">Abner son of Ner</name> and <name type="person">Amasa son of Jether</name>. He killed them, shedding their blood in peacetime as if in battle, and with that blood he stained the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.6">Deal with him according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to the grave in peace.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.7">"But show kindness to the sons of <name type="person">Barzillai the Gileadite</name> and let them be among those who eat at your table. They stood by me when I fled from your brother <name type="person">Absalom</name>.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.8">"And remember, you have with you <name type="person">Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim</name>, who called down bitter curses on me the day I went to <name type="geographic">Mahanaim</name>. When he came down to meet me at the <name type="geographic">Jordan</name>, I swore to him by <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>: 'I will not put you to death by the sword.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.9">But now, do not consider him innocent. You are a wise man; you will know what to do to him. Bring his gray head down to the grave in blood."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.10">Then <name type="person">David</name> rested with his ancestors and was buried in the <name type="geographic">City of David</name>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.11">He had reigned forty years over Israel—seven years in <name type="geographic">Hebron</name> and thirty-three in <name type="geographic">Jerusalem</name>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.12">So <name type="person">Solomon</name> sat on the throne of his father <name type="person">David</name>, and his rule was firmly established.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">Adonijah's Request and Execution</title>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.13">Now <name type="person">Adonijah son of Haggith</name> went to <name type="person">Bathsheba</name>, <name type="person">Solomon's</name> mother. <name type="person">Bathsheba</name> asked him, "Do you come peacefully?" He answered, "Yes, peacefully."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.14">Then he added, "I have something to say to you." "You may say it," she replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.15">"As you know," he said, "the kingdom was mine. All Israel looked to me as their king. But things changed, and the kingdom has gone to my brother; for it has come to him from <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.16">Now I have one request to make of you. Do not refuse me." "You may make it," she said.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.17">So he continued, "Please ask King <name type="person">Solomon</name>—he will not refuse you—to give me <name type="person">Abishag the Shunammite</name> as my wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.18">"Very well," <name type="person">Bathsheba</name> replied, "I will speak to the king for you."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.19">When <name type="person">Bathsheba</name> went to King <name type="person">Solomon</name> to speak to him for <name type="person">Adonijah</name>, the king stood up to meet her, bowed down to her and sat down on his throne. He had a throne brought for the king's mother, and she sat down at his right hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.20">"I have one small request to make of you," she said. "Do not refuse me." The king replied, "Make it, my mother; I will not refuse you."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.21">So she said, "Let <name type="person">Abishag the Shunammite</name> be given in marriage to your brother <name type="person">Adonijah</name>."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.22">King <name type="person">Solomon</name> answered his mother, "Why do you request <name type="person">Abishag the Shunammite</name> for <name type="person">Adonijah</name>? You might as well request the kingdom for him—after all, he is my older brother—yes, for him and for <name type="person">Abiathar the priest</name> and <name type="person">Joab son of Zeruiah</name>!"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.23">Then King <name type="person">Solomon</name> swore by <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>: "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if <name type="person">Adonijah</name> does not pay with his life for this request!</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.24">And now, as surely as <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> lives—he who has established me securely on the throne of my father <name type="person">David</name> and has founded a dynasty for me as he promised—<name type="person">Adonijah</name> shall be put to death today!"</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.25">So King <name type="person">Solomon</name> gave orders to <name type="person">Benaiah son of Jehoiada</name>, and he struck down <name type="person">Adonijah</name> and he died.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">Abiathar Banished and Joab Killed</title>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.26">To <name type="person">Abiathar the priest</name> the king said, "Go back to your fields in <name type="geographic">Anathoth</name>. You deserve to die, but I will not put you to death now, because you carried the ark of the Sovereign <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> before <name type="person">David</name> my father and shared all my father's hardships."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.27">So <name type="person">Solomon</name> banished <name type="person">Abiathar</name> from the priesthood of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, fulfilling the word <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> had spoken at <name type="geographic">Shiloh</name> about the house of <name type="person">Eli</name>.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.28">When the news reached <name type="person">Joab</name>, who had conspired with <name type="person">Adonijah</name> though not with <name type="person">Absalom</name>, he fled to the tent of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> and took hold of the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.29">King <name type="person">Solomon</name> was told that <name type="person">Joab</name> had fled to the tent of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> and was beside the altar. Then <name type="person">Solomon</name> ordered <name type="person">Benaiah son of Jehoiada</name>, "Go, strike him down!"</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.30">So <name type="person">Benaiah</name> entered the tent of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> and said to <name type="person">Joab</name>, "The king says, 'Come out!'" But he answered, "No, I will die here." <name type="person">Benaiah</name> reported to the king, "<name type="person">Joab</name> said this, and this is how he answered me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.31">Then the king commanded <name type="person">Benaiah</name>, "Do as he says. Strike him down and bury him, and so clear me and my whole family of the guilt of the innocent blood that <name type="person">Joab</name> shed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.32"><divineName>Yahweh</divineName> will repay him for the blood he shed, because without my father <name type="person">David's</name> knowledge he attacked two men and killed them with the sword. Both of them—<name type="person">Abner son of Ner</name>, commander of Israel's army, and <name type="person">Amasa son of Jether</name>, commander of Judah's army—were better men and more upright than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.33">May the guilt of their blood rest on the head of <name type="person">Joab</name> and his descendants forever. But on <name type="person">David</name> and his descendants, his house and his throne, may there be <divineName>Yahweh's</divineName> peace forever."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="1Kgs.2.34">So <name type="person">Benaiah son of Jehoiada</name> went up and struck down <name type="person">Joab</name> and killed him, and he was buried at his home in the wilderness.</verse>
