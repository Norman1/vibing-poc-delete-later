      <div type="introduction">
        <p>Romans provides Paul's most comprehensive explanation of the Christian gospel, systematically presenting how all people are sinful and separated from God, yet can be made right with God through faith in Jesus Christ alone. Written to believers in Rome whom Paul had not yet visited, this letter establishes the theological foundation for Christian doctrine and living. Paul demonstrates that salvation comes not through keeping the law or performing good works, but solely through God's grace received by faith. The letter addresses crucial questions about God's justice, the role of Israel, and how believers should live as people transformed by God's grace.</p>

      <verse osisID="Rom.1.1">Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the good news<note type="translation">Greek εὐαγγέλιον (euangelion) means "good news" or "gospel"</note> of God,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.1.2">which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the set apart for God scriptures</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.1.3">concerning his Son, who was born from the seed of David according to the flesh,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.1.4">who was declared Son of God in power according to the Spirit of being set apart for God by his resurrection from the dead—Jesus Christ our Lord,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.1.5">through whom we received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the nations for the sake of his name,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.1.6">among whom you also are called to belong to Jesus Christ.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.1.7">To all those in Rome who are loved by God, called to be people set apart for God<note type="translation">Greek ἅγιος (hagios) means "holy" or "set apart for God"</note>: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Paul's Desire to Visit Rome</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.1.8">First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being proclaimed throughout the whole world.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.1.9">For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the good news of his Son, how constantly I make mention of you,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.1.10">always asking in my prayers that somehow by God's will I may now at last succeed in coming to you.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.1.11">For I long to see you, so that I may share some spiritual gift with you to strengthen you—</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.1.12">that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both yours and mine.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.1.13">I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you (but have been prevented until now), in order that I might have some fruit among you as well as among the other nations.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.1.14">I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.1.15">So I am eager to preach the good news to you also who are in Rome.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">The Power of the Good News</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.1.16">For I am not ashamed of the good news, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.1.17">For in it the being in right standing with God<note type="translation">Greek δικαιοσύνη (dikaiosyne) means "righteousness" or "being in right standing with God"</note> of God is revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, "Those in right standing with God shall live by faith."</verse>
      
      <title type="main">God's Anger Against Sin</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.1.18">For the anger of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.1.19">For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.1.20">For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.1.21">For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.1.22">Claiming to be wise, they became fools,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.1.23">and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.1.24">Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.1.25">because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.1.26">For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature;</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.1.27">and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.1.28">And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.1.29">They were filled with all manner of being out of right standing with God, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.1.30">slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.1.31">foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.1.32">Though they know God's doing what's right decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.</verse>

      <title type="main">God's Righteous Judgment</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.2.1">Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.2.2">We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who practice such things.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.2.3">Do you suppose, O man—you who judge those who practice such things and yet do them yourself—that you will escape the judgment of God?</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.2.4">Or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God's kindness is meant to lead you to change your mind<note type="translation">Greek μετάνοια (metanoia) means "repentance" or "change of mind"</note>?</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.2.5">But because of your hard and unwilling to change mind heart you are storing up anger for yourself on the day of anger when God's doing what's right judgment will be revealed.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.2.6">He will render to each one according to his works:</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.2.7">to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life;</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.2.8">but for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey being out of right standing with God, there will be anger and wrath.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.2.9">There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.2.10">but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.2.11">For God shows no partiality.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">God's Law and Judgment</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.2.12">For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.2.13">For it is not the hearers of the law who are in right standing with God before God, but the doers of the law who will be declared innocent<note type="translation">Greek δικαιόω (dikaioo) means "to justify" or "to declare innocent"</note>.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.2.14">For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.2.15">They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.2.16">on that day when, according to my good news, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">The Jews and the Law</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.2.17">But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.2.18">and know his will and approve what is excellent, because you are instructed from the law;</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.2.19">and if you are sure that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.2.20">an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth—</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.2.21">you then who teach others, do you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing, do you steal?</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.2.22">You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.2.23">You who boast in the law dishonor God by breaking the law.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.2.24">For, as it is written, "The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you."</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.2.25">For circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.2.26">So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.2.27">Then he who is physically uncircumcised but keeps the law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the law.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.2.28">For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.2.29">But a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. His praise is not from man but from God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Rom.3" sID="Rom.3" />
      
      <title type="main">God's Faithfulness</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.3.1">Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision?</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.3.2">Much in every way. To begin with, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.3.3">What if some were unfaithful? Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God?</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.3.4">By no means! Let God be true though every one were a liar, as it is written, "That you may be declared innocent in your words, and prevail when you are judged."</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.3.5">But if our unrighteousness serves to show the being in right standing with God of God, what shall we say? That God is unrighteous to inflict anger on us? (I speak in a human way.)</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.3.6">By no means! For then how could God judge the world?</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.3.7">But if through my lie God's truth abounds to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner?</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.3.8">And why not do evil that good may come?—as some people slanderously charge us with saying. Their condemnation is just.</verse>
      
      <title type="main">No One Is Righteous</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.3.9">What then? Are we Jews any better off? No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.3.10">as it is written: "None is in right standing with God, no, not one;</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.3.11">no one understands; no one seeks for God.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.3.12">All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one."</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.3.13">"Their throat is an open grave; they use their tongues to deceive." "The venom of asps is under their lips."</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.3.14">"Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness."</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.3.15">"Their feet are swift to shed blood;</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.3.16">in their paths are ruin and misery,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.3.17">and the way of peace they have not known."</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.3.18">"There is no fear of God before their eyes."</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.3.19">Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.3.20">For by works of the law no human being will be declared innocent in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin.</verse>
      
      <title type="main">Being Made Right with God Through Faith</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.3.21">But now the being in right standing with God of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it—</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.3.22">the being in right standing with God of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction:</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.3.23">for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.3.24">and are being declared innocent by his grace as a gift, through the buying back that is in Christ Jesus,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.3.25">whom God put forward as satisfying God's anger<note type="translation">Greek ἱλαστήριον (hilasterion) means "propitiation" or "satisfying God's anger"</note> by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's being in right standing with God, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.3.26">It was to show his being in right standing with God at the present time, so that he might be just and the one who declares innocent the one who has faith in Jesus.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.3.27">Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.3.28">For we hold that one is declared innocent by faith apart from works of the law.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.3.29">Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.3.30">since God is one—who will declare innocent the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.3.31">Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.</verse>
      
      <chapter eID="Rom.3" />
      
      <chapter osisID="Rom.4" sID="Rom.4" />
      
      <title type="main">Abraham's Example of Faith</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.4.1">What then shall we say was gained by Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh?</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.4.2">For if Abraham was declared innocent by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.4.3">For what does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as being in right standing with God."</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.4.4">Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.4.5">And to the one who does not work but believes in him who declares innocent the ungodly, his faith is counted as being in right standing with God,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.4.6">just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts being in right standing with God apart from works:</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.4.7">"Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.4.8">blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count his sin."</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.4.9">Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? For we say that faith was counted to Abraham as being in right standing with God.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.4.10">How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.4.11">He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the being in right standing with God that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that being in right standing with God would be counted to them as well,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.4.12">and to make him the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">The Promise Realized Through Faith</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.4.13">For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the being in right standing with God of faith.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.4.14">For if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.4.15">For the law brings anger, but where there is no law there is no transgression.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.4.16">That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring—not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.4.17">as it is written, "I have made you the father of many nations"—in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.4.18">In hope he believed against hope, that he should become the father of many nations, as he had been told, "So shall your offspring be."</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.4.19">He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead (since he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah's womb.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.4.20">No unbelief made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.4.21">fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.4.22">That is why his faith "was counted to him as being in right standing with God."</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.4.23">But the words "it was counted to him" were not written for his sake alone,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.4.24">but for ours also. It will be counted to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.4.25">who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our being declared innocent.</verse>

      <title type="main">Benefits of Being Made Right with God</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.5.1">Therefore, since we have been declared innocent by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.5.2">Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.5.3">Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.5.4">and endurance produces character, and character produces hope,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.5.5">and hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.5.6">For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.5.7">For one will scarcely die for a person in right standing with God—though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die—</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.5.8">but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.5.9">Since, therefore, we have now been declared innocent by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the anger of God.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.5.10">For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.5.11">More than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.</verse>
      
      <title type="main">Death in Adam, Life in Christ</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.5.12">Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned—</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.5.13">for sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no law.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.5.14">Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sinning was not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.5.15">But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if many died through one man's trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for many.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.5.16">And the free gift is not like the result of that one man's sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brought being declared innocent.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.5.17">For if, because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of being in right standing with God reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.5.18">Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of being in right standing with God leads to being declared innocent and life for all men.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.5.19">For as by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man's obedience the many will be made in right standing with God.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.5.20">Now the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.5.21">so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through being in right standing with God leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Rom.6.1">What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.6.2">By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it?</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.6.3">Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.6.4">We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.6.5">For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.6.6">We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.6.7">For one who has died has been set free from sin.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.6.8">Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.6.9">We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.6.10">For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.6.11">So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.6.12">Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to make you obey its passions.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.6.13">Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for doing what's right.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.6.14">For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.</verse>

By no means!</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.6.16">Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to being in right standing with God?</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.6.17">But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.6.18">and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of being in right standing with God.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.6.19">I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to being in right standing with God leading to being set apart for God.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.6.20">For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to being in right standing with God.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.6.21">But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.6.22">But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to being set apart for God, and its end, eternal life.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.6.23">For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Rom.7.1">Or do you not know, brothers—for I am speaking to those who know the law—that the law is binding on a person only as long as he lives?</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.7.2">For a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives, but if her husband dies she is released from the law concerning the husband.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.7.3">Accordingly, she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.7.4">Likewise, my brothers, you also have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who has been raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.7.5">For while we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bear fruit for death.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.7.6">But now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit and not in the old way of the written code.</verse>
      
      <title type="main">The Law and Sin</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.7.7">What then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet if it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. For I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, "You shall not covet."</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.7.8">But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness. For apart from the law, sin lies dead.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.7.9">I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin came alive and I died.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.7.10">The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.7.11">For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.7.12">So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.7.13">Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no means! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.7.14">For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh, sold under sin.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.7.15">For I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.7.16">Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.7.17">So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.7.18">For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.7.19">For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.7.20">Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.7.21">So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.7.22">For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.7.23">but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.7.24">Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death?</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.7.25">Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Rom.8.1">There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.2">For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.3">For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.4">in order that the doing what's right requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.5">For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.6">For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.7">For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law; indeed, it cannot.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.8">Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.8.9">You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.10">But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of being in right standing with God.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.11">If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.</verse>

Father!"</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.16">The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.17">and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Rom.8.18">For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.19">For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.20">For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.21">that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.22">For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.23">And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the buying back of our bodies.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.24">For in this hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees?</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.25">But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.8.26">Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.27">And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the people set apart for God according to the will of God.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Rom.8.28">And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.29">For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.30">And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also declared innocent, and those whom he declared innocent he also glorified.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.8.31">What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.32">He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.33">Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who declares innocent.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.34">Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.35">Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.36">As it is written, "For your sake we are being killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered."</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.37">No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.38">For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.8.39">nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>

Amen.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.9.6">But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.9.7">and not all are children of Abraham because they are his offspring, but "Through Isaac shall your offspring be named."</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.9.8">This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as offspring.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.9.9">For this is what the promise said: "About this time next year I will return, and Sarah shall have a son."</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.9.10">And not only so, but also when Rebekah had conceived children by one man, our forefather Isaac,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.9.11">though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad—in order that God's purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of him who calls—</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.9.12">she was told, "The older will serve the younger."</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.9.13">As it is written, "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."</verse>

      <verse osisID="Rom.9.19">You will say to me then, "Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?"</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.9.20">But who are you, O man, to answer back to God?

      <verse osisID="Rom.10.5">For Moses writes about the being in right standing with God that is based on the law, that the person who does the commandments shall live by them.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.10.6">But the being in right standing with God based on faith says, "Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?'" (that is, to bring Christ down)</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.10.7">"or 'Who will descend into the abyss?'" (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.10.8">But what does it say? "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart" (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim);</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.10.9">because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.10.10">For with the heart one believes and is declared innocent, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.10.11">For the Scripture says, "Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame."</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.10.12">For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.10.13">For "everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.10.14">How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching?</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.10.15">And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news!"</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.10.16">But they have not all obeyed the good news. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed what he has heard from us?"</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.10.17">So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.10.18">But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have, for "Their voice has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world."</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.10.19">But I ask, did Israel not understand? First Moses says, "I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation; with a foolish nation I will make you angry."</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.10.20">Then Isaiah is so bold as to say, "I have been found by those who did not seek me; I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me."</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.10.21">But of Israel he says, "All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people."</verse>

They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith. So do not become proud, but fear.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.11.21">For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.11.22">Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.11.23">And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.11.24">For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Rom.12.1">I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, set apart for God and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.12.2">Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Gifts of Grace</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.12.3">For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.12.4">For as in one body we have many members, and the members do not all have the same function,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.12.5">so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.12.6">Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, in proportion to our faith;</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.12.7">if service, in our serving; the one who teaches, in his teaching;</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.12.8">the one who exhorts, in his exhortation; the one who contributes, in generosity; the one who leads, with zeal; the one who does acts of mercy, with cheerfulness.</verse>
      
      <title type="main">Marks of the True Christian</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.12.9">Let love be genuine. Abhor what is evil; hold fast to what is good.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.12.10">Love one another with brotherly affection. Outdo one another in showing honor.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.12.11">Do not be slothful in zeal, be fervent in spirit, serve the Lord.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.12.12">Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.12.13">Contribute to the needs of the people set apart for God and seek to show hospitality.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.12.14">Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.12.15">Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.12.16">Live in harmony with one another. Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly. Never be wise in your own sight.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.12.17">Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.12.18">If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.12.19">Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the anger of God, for it is written, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord."</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.12.20">To the contrary, "if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head."</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.12.21">Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.</verse>

      <title type="main">Submission to the Authorities</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.13.1">Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.13.2">Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.13.3">For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.13.4">for he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God's anger on the wrongdoer.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.13.5">Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God's anger but also for the sake of conscience.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.13.6">For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.13.7">Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.</verse>
      
      <title type="main">Fulfilling the Law Through Love</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.13.8">Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.13.9">For the commandments, "You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet," and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.13.10">Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Put On Christ</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.13.11">Besides this you know the time, that the hour has come for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.13.12">The night is far gone; the day is at hand. So then let us cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.13.13">Let us walk properly as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, not in quarreling and jealousy.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.13.14">But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Rom.14" sID="Rom.14" />
      
      <title type="main">Do Not Pass Judgment on One Another</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.14.1">As for the one who is weak in faith, welcome him, but not to quarrel over opinions.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.14.2">One person believes he may eat anything, while the weak person eats only vegetables.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.14.3">Let not the one who eats despise the one who abstains, and let not the one who abstains pass judgment on the one who eats, for God has welcomed him.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.14.4">Who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another? It is before his own master that he stands or falls. And he will be upheld, for the Lord is able to make him stand.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.14.5">One person esteems one day as better than another, while another esteems all days alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.14.6">The one who observes the day, observes it in honor of the Lord. The one who eats, eats in honor of the Lord, since he gives thanks to God, while the one who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.14.7">For none of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.14.8">For if we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. So then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.14.9">For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.14.10">Why do you pass judgment on your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God;</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.14.11">for it is written, "As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God."</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.14.12">So then each of us will give an account of himself to God.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Do Not Cause Another to Stumble</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.14.13">Therefore let us not pass judgment on one another any longer, but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.14.14">I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself, but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.14.15">For if your brother is grieved by what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. By what you eat, do not destroy the one for whom Christ died.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.14.16">So do not let what you regard as good be spoken of as evil.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.14.17">For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but of being in right standing with God and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.14.18">Whoever thus serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.14.19">So then let us pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.14.20">Do not, for the sake of food, destroy the work of God. Everything is indeed clean, but it is wrong for anyone to make another stumble by what he eats.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.14.21">It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.14.22">The faith that you have, keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who has no reason to pass judgment on himself for what he approves.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.14.23">But whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats, because the eating is not from faith. For whatever does not proceed from faith is sin.</verse>

      <title type="main">The Example of Christ</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.15.1">We who are strong have an obligation to bear with the failings of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.2">Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to build him up.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.3">For Christ did not please himself, but as it is written, "The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me."</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.4">For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.5">May the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one another, in accord with Christ Jesus,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.6">that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.15.7">Therefore welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.8">For I tell you that Christ became a servant to the circumcised to show God's truthfulness, in order to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.9">and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written, "Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles, and sing to your name."</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.10">And again it is said, "Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people."</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.11">And again, "Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all the peoples extol him."</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.12">And again Isaiah says, "The root of Jesse will come, even he who arises to rule the Gentiles; in him will the Gentiles hope."</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.13">May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope.</verse>
      
      <title type="main">Paul the Minister to the Gentiles</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.15.14">I myself am satisfied about you, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge and able to instruct one another.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.15">But on some points I have written to you very boldly by way of reminder, because of the grace given me by God</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.16">to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the good news of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable, being set apart by the Holy Spirit.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.17">In Christ Jesus, then, I have reason to be proud of my work for God.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.18">For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to bring the Gentiles to obedience—by word and deed,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.19">by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God—so that from Jerusalem and all the way around to Illyricum I have fulfilled the ministry of the good news of Christ;</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.20">and thus I make it my ambition to preach the good news, not where Christ has already been named, lest I build on someone else's foundation,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.21">but as it is written, "Those who have never been told of him will see, and those who have never heard will understand."</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Paul's Plan to Visit Rome</title>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.15.22">This is the reason why I have so often been hindered from coming to you.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.23">But now, since I no longer have any room for work in these regions, and since I have longed for many years to come to you,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.24">I hope to see you in passing as I go to Spain, and to be helped on my journey there by you, once I have enjoyed your company for a while.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.25">At present, however, I am going to Jerusalem bringing aid to the people set apart for God.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.26">For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make some contribution for the poor among the people set apart for God in Jerusalem.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.27">For they were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings, they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.28">When therefore I have completed this and have delivered to them what has been collected, I will leave for Spain by way of you.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.29">I know that when I come to you I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.</verse>
      
      <verse osisID="Rom.15.30">I appeal to you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God on my behalf,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.31">that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the people set apart for God,</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.32">so that by God's will I may come to you with joy and be refreshed in your company.</verse> <verse osisID="Rom.15.33">May the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</verse>
