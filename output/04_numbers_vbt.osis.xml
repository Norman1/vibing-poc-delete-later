      <title type="sub">The Levites</title>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.1">This is the account of the family of Aaron and Moses at the time Yahweh spoke with Moses at Mount Sinai.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.2">The names of the sons of Aaron were Nadab the firstborn and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.3">Those were the names of Aaron's sons, the anointed priests, who were ordained to serve as priests.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.4">Nadab and Abihu, however, died before Yahweh when they made an offering with unauthorized fire before him in the Desert of Sinai. They had no sons, so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during the lifetime of their father Aaron.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.5">Yahweh said to Moses,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.6">"Bring the tribe of Levi and present them to Aaron the priest to assist him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.7">They are to perform duties for him and for the whole community at the tent of meeting by doing the work of the tabernacle.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.8">They are to take care of all the furnishings of the tent of meeting, fulfilling the obligations of the Israelites by doing the work of the tabernacle.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.9">Give the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they are the Israelites who are to be given wholly to him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.10">Appoint Aaron and his sons to serve as priests; anyone else who approaches the sanctuary is to be put to death."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.11">Yahweh also said to Moses,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.12">"I have taken the Levites from among the Israelites in place of the first male offspring of every Israelite woman. The Levites are mine,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.13">for all the firstborn are mine. When I struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, I set apart for myself every firstborn in Israel, whether human or animal. They are to be mine. I am Yahweh."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.14">Yahweh said to Moses in the Desert of Sinai,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.15">"Count the Levites by their families and clans. Count every male a month old or more."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.16">So Moses counted them, as he was commanded by the word of Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.17">These were the names of the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.18">These were the names of the Gershonite clans: Libni and Shimei.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.19">The Kohathite clans: Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.20">The Merarite clans: Mahli and Mushi. These were the Levite clans, according to their families.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.21">To Gershon belonged the clans of the Libnites and Shimeites; these were the Gershonite clans.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.22">The number of all the males a month old or more who were counted was 7,500.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.23">The Gershonite clans were to camp on the west, behind the tabernacle.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.24">The leader of the families of the Gershonites was Eliasaph son of Lael.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.25">At the tent of meeting the Gershonites were responsible for the care of the tabernacle and tent, its coverings, the curtain at the entrance to the tent of meeting,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.26">the curtains of the courtyard, the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard surrounding the tabernacle and altar, and the ropes—and everything related to their use.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.27">To Kohath belonged the clans of the Amramites, Izharites, Hebronites and Uzzielites; these were the Kohathite clans.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.28">The number of all the males a month old or more was 8,600. The Kohathites were responsible for the care of the sanctuary.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.29">The Kohathite clans were to camp on the south side of the tabernacle.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.30">The leader of the families of the Kohathite clans was Elizaphan son of Uzziel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.31">They were responsible for the care of the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the articles of the sanctuary used in ministering, the curtain, and everything related to their use.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.32">The chief leader of the Levites was Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest. He was appointed over those who were responsible for the care of the sanctuary.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.33">To Merari belonged the clans of the Mahlites and the Mushites; these were the Merarite clans.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.34">The number of all the males a month old or more who were counted was 6,200.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.35">The leader of the families of the Merarite clans was Zuriel son of Abihail; they were to camp on the north side of the tabernacle.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.36">The Merarites were appointed to take care of the frames of the tabernacle, its crossbars, posts, bases, all its equipment, and everything related to their use,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.37">as well as the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs and ropes.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.38">Moses and Aaron and his sons were to camp to the east of the tabernacle, toward the sunrise, in front of the tent of meeting. They were responsible for the care of the sanctuary on behalf of the Israelites. Anyone else who approached the sanctuary was to be put to death.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.39">The total number of Levites counted at Yahweh's command by Moses and Aaron according to their clans, including every male a month old or more, was 22,000.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.40">Yahweh said to Moses, "Count all the firstborn Israelite males who are a month old or more and make a list of their names.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.41">Take the Levites for me in place of all the firstborn of the Israelites, and the livestock of the Levites in place of all the firstborn of the livestock of the Israelites. I am Yahweh."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.42">So Moses counted all the firstborn of the Israelites, as Yahweh commanded him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.43">The total number of firstborn males a month old or more, listed by name, was 22,273.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.44">Yahweh also said to Moses,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.45">"Take the Levites in place of all the firstborn of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites in place of their livestock. The Levites are to be mine. I am Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.46">To redeem the 273 firstborn Israelites who exceed the number of the Levites,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.47">collect five shekels for each one, according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.48">Give the money for the redemption of the additional Israelites to Aaron and his sons."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.49">So Moses collected the redemption money from those who exceeded the number redeemed by the Levites.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.50">From the firstborn of the Israelites he collected silver weighing 1,365 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.51">Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and his sons, as he was commanded by the word of Yahweh.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.4.2">"Take a census of the Kohathite branch of the Levites by their clans and families.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.3">Count all the men from thirty to fifty years of age who come to serve in the work at the tent of meeting.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.4">This is the work of the Kohathites at the tent of meeting: the care of the most set apart things.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.5">When the camp is to move, Aaron and his sons are to go in and take down the shielding curtain and put it over the ark of the covenant law.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.6">Then they are to cover the curtain with a durable leather, spread a cloth of solid blue over that and put the poles in place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.7">Over the table of the Presence they are to spread a blue cloth and put on it the plates, dishes and bowls, and the jars for drink offerings; the bread that is continually there is to remain on it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.8">They are to spread a scarlet cloth over them, cover that with the durable leather and put the poles in place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.9">They are to take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand that is for light, together with its lamps, its wick trimmers and trays, and all its jars for the olive oil used to supply it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.10">Then they are to wrap it and all its accessories in a covering of the durable leather and put it on a carrying frame.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.11">Over the gold altar they are to spread a blue cloth and cover that with the durable leather and put the poles in place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.12">They are to take all the articles used for ministering in the sanctuary, wrap them in a blue cloth, cover that with the durable leather and put them on a carrying frame.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.13">They are to remove the ashes from the bronze altar and spread a purple cloth over it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.14">Then they are to place on it all the utensils used for ministering at the altar, including the firepans, meat forks, shovels and sprinkling bowls. Over it they are to spread a covering of the durable leather and put the poles in place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.15">After Aaron and his sons have finished covering the set apart furnishings and all the set apart articles, and when the camp is ready to move, only then are the Kohathites to come and do the carrying. But they must not touch the set apart things or they will die. The Kohathites are to carry those things that are in the tent of meeting.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.16">Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, is to have charge of the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the regular grain offering and the anointing oil. He is in charge of the entire tabernacle and everything in it, including its set apart furnishings and articles."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.17">Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron,</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.5.16">The priest shall bring her and have her stand before Yahweh.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.5.23">The priest is to write these curses on a scroll and then wash them off into the bitter water.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.5.27">If she has made herself impure and been unfaithful to her husband, this will be the result: When she is made to drink the water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering, it will enter her, her abdomen will swell and her womb will miscarry, and she will become a curse.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.5.28">If, however, the woman has not made herself impure, but is clean, she will be cleared of guilt and will be able to have children.</verse>

      <title type="sub">Setting Up the Lamps</title>
      <verse osisID="Num.8.1">Yahweh said to Moses,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.8.2">"Speak to Aaron and say to him, 'When you set up the lamps, see that all seven light up the area in front of the lampstand.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.8.3">Aaron did so; he set up the lamps so that they faced forward on the lampstand, just as Yahweh commanded Moses.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.8.4">This is how the lampstand was made: It was made of hammered gold—from its base to its blossoms. The lampstand was made exactly like the pattern Yahweh had shown Moses.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.8.5">Yahweh said to Moses:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.8.6">"Take the Levites from among all the Israelites and make them ceremonially clean.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.8.7">To purify them, do this: Sprinkle the water of cleansing on them; then have them shave their whole bodies and wash their clothes. And so they will purify themselves.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.8.8">Have them take a young bull with its grain offering of the finest flour mixed with olive oil; then you are to take a second young bull for a wrongdoing offering.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.8.9">Bring the Levites to the front of the tent of meeting and assemble the whole Israelite community.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.8.10">You are to bring the Levites before Yahweh, and the Israelites are to lay their hands on them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.8.11">Aaron is to present the Levites before Yahweh as a wave offering from the Israelites, so that they may be ready to do the work of Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.8.12">Then the Levites are to lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, using one for a wrongdoing offering to Yahweh and the other for a burnt offering, to make atonement for the Levites.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.8.13">Have the Levites stand in front of Aaron and his sons and then present them as a wave offering to Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.8.14">In this way you are to set the Levites apart from the other Israelites, and the Levites will be mine.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.8.15">After you have purified the Levites and presented them as a wave offering, they are to come to do their work at the tent of meeting.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.8.16">They are the Israelites who are to be given wholly to me. I have taken them as my own in place of the firstborn, the first male offspring of every Israelite woman.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.8.17">Every firstborn male in Israel, whether human or animal, is mine. When I struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, I set them apart for myself.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.8.18">And I have taken the Levites in place of all the firstborn sons in Israel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.8.19">From among all the Israelites, I have given the Levites as gifts to Aaron and his sons to do the work at the tent of meeting on behalf of the Israelites and to make atonement for them so that no plague will strike the Israelites when they go near the sanctuary."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.8.20">Moses, Aaron and the whole Israelite community did with the Levites just as Yahweh commanded Moses.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.8.21">The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes. Then Aaron presented them as a wave offering before Yahweh and made atonement for them to purify them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.8.22">After that, the Levites came to do their work at the tent of meeting under the supervision of Aaron and his sons. They did with the Levites just as Yahweh commanded Moses.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.8.23">Yahweh said to Moses,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.8.24">"This applies to the Levites: Men twenty-five years old or more shall come to take part in the work at the tent of meeting,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.8.25">but at the age of fifty, they must retire from their regular service and work no longer.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.8.26">They may assist their brothers in performing their duties at the tent of meeting, but they themselves must not do the work. This, then, is how you are to assign the responsibilities of the Levites."</verse>

      <title type="sub">The Passover</title>
      <verse osisID="Num.9.1">Yahweh spoke to Moses in the Desert of Sinai in the first month of the second year after they came out of Egypt. He said,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.9.2">"Have the Israelites celebrate the Passover at the appointed time.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.9.3">Celebrate it at the appointed time, at twilight on the fourteenth day of this month, in accordance with all its rules and regulations."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.9.4">So Moses told the Israelites to celebrate the Passover,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.9.5">and they did so in the Desert of Sinai at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month. The Israelites did everything just as Yahweh commanded Moses.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.9.6">But some of them could not celebrate the Passover on that day because they were ceremonially unclean on account of a dead body. So they came to Moses and Aaron that same day</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.9.7">and said to Moses, "We have become unclean because of a dead body, but why should we be kept from presenting Yahweh's offering with the other Israelites at the appointed time?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.9.8">Moses answered them, "Wait until I find out what Yahweh commands concerning you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.9.9">Then Yahweh said to Moses,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.9.10">"Tell the Israelites: 'When any of you or your descendants are unclean because of a dead body or are away on a journey, they are still to celebrate Yahweh's Passover,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.9.11">but they are to do it on the fourteenth day of the second month at twilight. They are to eat the lamb, together with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.9.12">They must not leave any of it till morning or break any of its bones. When they celebrate the Passover, they must follow all the regulations.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.9.13">But if anyone who is ceremonially clean and not on a journey fails to celebrate the Passover, they must be cut off from their people for not presenting Yahweh's offering at the appointed time. They will bear the consequences of their wrongdoing.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.9.14">A foreigner residing among you is also to celebrate Yahweh's Passover in accordance with its rules and regulations. You must have the same regulations for both the foreigner and the native-born.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.9.15">On the day the tabernacle, the tent of the covenant law, was set up, the cloud covered it. From evening till morning the cloud above the tabernacle looked like fire.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.9.16">That is how it continued to be; the cloud covered it, and at night it looked like fire.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.9.17">Whenever the cloud lifted from above the tent, the Israelites set out; wherever the cloud settled, the Israelites encamped.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.9.18">At Yahweh's command the Israelites set out, and at his command they encamped. As long as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle, they remained in camp.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.9.19">When the cloud remained over the tabernacle a long time, the Israelites obeyed Yahweh's order and did not set out.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.9.20">Sometimes the cloud was over the tabernacle only a few days; at Yahweh's command they would encamp, and then at his command they would set out.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.9.21">Sometimes the cloud stayed only from evening till morning, and when it lifted in the morning, they set out. Whether by day or by night, whenever the cloud lifted, they set out.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.9.22">Whether the cloud stayed over the tabernacle for two days or a month or a year, the Israelites would remain in camp and not set out; but when it lifted, they would set out.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.9.23">At Yahweh's command they encamped, and at Yahweh's command they set out. They obeyed Yahweh's order, in accordance with his command through Moses.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.10.1">Yahweh said to Moses:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.2">"Make two trumpets of hammered silver, and use them for calling the community together and for having the camps set out.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.3">When both are sounded, the whole community is to assemble before you at the entrance to the tent of meeting.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.4">If only one is sounded, the leaders—the heads of the clans of Israel—are to assemble before you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.5">When a trumpet blast is sounded, the tribes camping on the east are to set out.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.6">At the sounding of a second blast, the camps on the south are to set out. The blast will be the signal for setting out.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.7">To gather the assembly, blow the trumpets, but not with the signal for setting out.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.8">The sons of Aaron, the priests, are to blow the trumpets. This is to be a lasting ordinance for you and the generations to come.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.9">When you go into battle in your own land against an enemy who is oppressing you, sound a blast on the trumpets. Then you will be remembered by Yahweh your God and rescued from your enemies.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.10">Also at your times of rejoicing—your appointed festivals and New Moon feasts—you are to sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, and they will be a memorial for you before your God. I am Yahweh your God."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.11">On the twentieth day of the second month of the second year, the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle of the covenant law.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.12">Then the Israelites set out from the Desert of Sinai and traveled from place to place until the cloud came to rest in the Desert of Paran.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.13">They set out, this first time, at Yahweh's command through Moses.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.14">The divisions of the camp of Judah went first, under their standard. Nahshon son of Amminadab was in command.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.15">Nethanel son of Zuar was over the division of the tribe of Issachar,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.16">and Eliab son of Helon was over the division of the tribe of Zebulun.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.17">Then the tabernacle was taken down, and the Gershonites and Merarites, who carried it, set out.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.18">The divisions of the camp of Reuben went next, under their standard. Elizur son of Shedeur was in command.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.19">Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was over the division of the tribe of Simeon,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.20">and Eliasaph son of Deuel was over the division of the tribe of Gad.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.21">Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the sacred objects. The tabernacle was to be set up before they arrived.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.22">The divisions of the camp of Ephraim went next, under their standard. Elishama son of Ammihud was in command.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.23">Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of Manasseh,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.24">and Abidan son of Gideoni was over the division of the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.25">Finally, as the rear guard for all the units, the divisions of the camp of Dan set out under their standard. Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai was in command.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.26">Pagiel son of Okran was over the division of the tribe of Asher,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.27">and Ahira son of Enan was over the division of the tribe of Naphtali.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.28">This was the order of march for the Israelite divisions as they set out.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.29">Now Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, "We are setting out for the place about which Yahweh said, 'I will give it to you.' Come with us and we will treat you well, for Yahweh has promised good things to Israel."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.30">He answered, "No, I will not go; I am going back to my own land and my own people."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.10.31">But Moses said, "Please do not leave us. You know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you can be our eyes.</verse>
