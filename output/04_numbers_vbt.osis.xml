      <title type="sub">The Levites</title>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.1">This is the account of the family of Aaron and Moses at the time Yahweh spoke with Moses at Mount Sinai.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.2">The names of the sons of Aaron were Nadab the firstborn and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.3">Those were the names of Aaron's sons, the anointed priests, who were ordained to serve as priests.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.4">Nadab and Abihu, however, died before Yahweh when they made an offering with unauthorized fire before him in the Desert of Sinai. They had no sons, so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during the lifetime of their father Aaron.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.5">Yahweh said to Moses,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.6">"Bring the tribe of Levi and present them to Aaron the priest to assist him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.7">They are to perform duties for him and for the whole community at the tent of meeting by doing the work of the tabernacle.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.8">They are to take care of all the furnishings of the tent of meeting, fulfilling the obligations of the Israelites by doing the work of the tabernacle.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.9">Give the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they are the Israelites who are to be given wholly to him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.10">Appoint Aaron and his sons to serve as priests; anyone else who approaches the sanctuary is to be put to death."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.11">Yahweh also said to Moses,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.12">"I have taken the Levites from among the Israelites in place of the first male offspring of every Israelite woman. The Levites are mine,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.13">for all the firstborn are mine. When I struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, I set apart for myself every firstborn in Israel, whether human or animal. They are to be mine. I am Yahweh."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.14">Yahweh said to Moses in the Desert of Sinai,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.15">"Count the Levites by their families and clans. Count every male a month old or more."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.16">So Moses counted them, as he was commanded by the word of Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.17">These were the names of the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.18">These were the names of the Gershonite clans: Libni and Shimei.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.19">The Kohathite clans: Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.20">The Merarite clans: Mahli and Mushi. These were the Levite clans, according to their families.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.21">To Gershon belonged the clans of the Libnites and Shimeites; these were the Gershonite clans.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.22">The number of all the males a month old or more who were counted was 7,500.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.23">The Gershonite clans were to camp on the west, behind the tabernacle.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.24">The leader of the families of the Gershonites was Eliasaph son of Lael.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.25">At the tent of meeting the Gershonites were responsible for the care of the tabernacle and tent, its coverings, the curtain at the entrance to the tent of meeting,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.26">the curtains of the courtyard, the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard surrounding the tabernacle and altar, and the ropes—and everything related to their use.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.27">To Kohath belonged the clans of the Amramites, Izharites, Hebronites and Uzzielites; these were the Kohathite clans.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.28">The number of all the males a month old or more was 8,600. The Kohathites were responsible for the care of the sanctuary.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.29">The Kohathite clans were to camp on the south side of the tabernacle.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.30">The leader of the families of the Kohathite clans was Elizaphan son of Uzziel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.31">They were responsible for the care of the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the articles of the sanctuary used in ministering, the curtain, and everything related to their use.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.32">The chief leader of the Levites was Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest. He was appointed over those who were responsible for the care of the sanctuary.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.33">To Merari belonged the clans of the Mahlites and the Mushites; these were the Merarite clans.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.34">The number of all the males a month old or more who were counted was 6,200.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.35">The leader of the families of the Merarite clans was Zuriel son of Abihail; they were to camp on the north side of the tabernacle.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.36">The Merarites were appointed to take care of the frames of the tabernacle, its crossbars, posts, bases, all its equipment, and everything related to their use,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.37">as well as the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs and ropes.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.38">Moses and Aaron and his sons were to camp to the east of the tabernacle, toward the sunrise, in front of the tent of meeting. They were responsible for the care of the sanctuary on behalf of the Israelites. Anyone else who approached the sanctuary was to be put to death.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.39">The total number of Levites counted at Yahweh's command by Moses and Aaron according to their clans, including every male a month old or more, was 22,000.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.40">Yahweh said to Moses, "Count all the firstborn Israelite males who are a month old or more and make a list of their names.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.41">Take the Levites for me in place of all the firstborn of the Israelites, and the livestock of the Levites in place of all the firstborn of the livestock of the Israelites. I am Yahweh."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.42">So Moses counted all the firstborn of the Israelites, as Yahweh commanded him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.43">The total number of firstborn males a month old or more, listed by name, was 22,273.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.44">Yahweh also said to Moses,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.45">"Take the Levites in place of all the firstborn of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites in place of their livestock. The Levites are to be mine. I am Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.46">To redeem the 273 firstborn Israelites who exceed the number of the Levites,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.47">collect five shekels for each one, according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.48">Give the money for the redemption of the additional Israelites to Aaron and his sons."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.49">So Moses collected the redemption money from those who exceeded the number redeemed by the Levites.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.50">From the firstborn of the Israelites he collected silver weighing 1,365 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.51">Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and his sons, as he was commanded by the word of Yahweh.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.4.2">"Take a census of the Kohathite branch of the Levites by their clans and families.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.3">Count all the men from thirty to fifty years of age who come to serve in the work at the tent of meeting.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.4">This is the work of the Kohathites at the tent of meeting: the care of the most set apart things.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.5">When the camp is to move, Aaron and his sons are to go in and take down the shielding curtain and put it over the ark of the covenant law.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.6">Then they are to cover the curtain with a durable leather, spread a cloth of solid blue over that and put the poles in place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.7">Over the table of the Presence they are to spread a blue cloth and put on it the plates, dishes and bowls, and the jars for drink offerings; the bread that is continually there is to remain on it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.8">They are to spread a scarlet cloth over them, cover that with the durable leather and put the poles in place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.9">They are to take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand that is for light, together with its lamps, its wick trimmers and trays, and all its jars for the olive oil used to supply it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.10">Then they are to wrap it and all its accessories in a covering of the durable leather and put it on a carrying frame.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.11">Over the gold altar they are to spread a blue cloth and cover that with the durable leather and put the poles in place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.12">They are to take all the articles used for ministering in the sanctuary, wrap them in a blue cloth, cover that with the durable leather and put them on a carrying frame.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.13">They are to remove the ashes from the bronze altar and spread a purple cloth over it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.14">Then they are to place on it all the utensils used for ministering at the altar, including the firepans, meat forks, shovels and sprinkling bowls. Over it they are to spread a covering of the durable leather and put the poles in place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.15">After Aaron and his sons have finished covering the set apart furnishings and all the set apart articles, and when the camp is ready to move, only then are the Kohathites to come and do the carrying. But they must not touch the set apart things or they will die. The Kohathites are to carry those things that are in the tent of meeting.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.16">Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, is to have charge of the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the regular grain offering and the anointing oil. He is in charge of the entire tabernacle and everything in it, including its set apart furnishings and articles."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.17">Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron,</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.5.16">The priest shall bring her and have her stand before Yahweh.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.5.23">The priest is to write these curses on a scroll and then wash them off into the bitter water.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.5.27">If she has made herself impure and been unfaithful to her husband, this will be the result: When she is made to drink the water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering, it will enter her, her abdomen will swell and her womb will miscarry, and she will become a curse.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.5.28">If, however, the woman has not made herself impure, but is clean, she will be cleared of guilt and will be able to have children.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.11.11">He asked Yahweh, "Why have you brought this trouble on your servant? What have I done to displease you that you put the burden of all these people on me?</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.11.17">I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take some of the power of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them. They will share the burden of the people with you so that you will not have to carry it alone.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.11.18">Tell the people: 'Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow, when you will eat meat. Yahweh heard you when you wailed, "If only we had meat to eat! We were better off in Egypt!" Now Yahweh will give you meat, and you will eat it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.11.19">You will not eat it for just one day, or two days, or five, ten or twenty days,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.11.20">but for a whole month—until it comes out of your nostrils and you loathe it—because you have rejected Yahweh, who is among you, and have wailed before him, saying, "Why did we ever leave Egypt?"'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.11.21">But Moses said, "Here I am among six hundred thousand men on foot, and you say, 'I will give them meat to eat for a whole month!'</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.11.25">Then Yahweh came down in the cloud and spoke with him, and he took some of the power of the Spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied—but did not do so again.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.11.26">However, two men, whose names were Eldad and Medad, had remained in the camp. They were listed among the elders, but did not go out to the tent. Yet the Spirit also rested on them, and they prophesied in the camp.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.13.5">from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.6">from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.7">from the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.8">from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.9">from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.10">from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.11">from the tribe of Manasseh (a tribe of Joseph), Gaddi son of Susi;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.12">from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.13">from the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.14">from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.15">from the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Maki.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.16">These are the names of the men Moses sent to explore the land. (Moses gave Hoshea son of Nun the name Joshua.)</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.17">When Moses sent them to explore Canaan, he said, "Go up through the Negev and on into the hill country.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.18">See what the land is like and whether the people who live there are strong or weak, few or many.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.19">What kind of land do they live in? Is it good or bad? What kind of towns do they live in? Are they unwalled or fortified?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.20">How is the soil? Is it fertile or poor? Are there trees in it or not? Do your best to bring back some of the fruit of the land." (It was the season for the first ripe grapes.)</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.21">So they went up and explored the land from the Desert of Zin as far as Rehob, toward Lebo Hamath.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.22">They went up through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, lived. (Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.23">When they reached the Valley of Eshkol, they cut off a branch bearing a single cluster of grapes. Two of them carried it on a pole between them, along with some pomegranates and figs.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.24">That place was called the Valley of Eshkol because of the cluster of grapes the Israelites cut off there.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.25">At the end of forty days they returned from exploring the land.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.26">They came back to Moses and Aaron and the whole Israelite community at Kadesh in the Desert of Paran. There they reported to them and to the whole assembly and showed them the fruit of the land.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.27">They gave Moses this account: "We went into the land to which you sent us, and it does flow with milk and honey! Here is its fruit.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.28">But the people who live there are powerful, and the cities are fortified and very large. We even saw descendants of Anak there.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.29">The Amalekites live in the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites and Amorites live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live near the sea and along the Jordan."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.30">Then Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, "We should go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly do it."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.31">But the men who had gone up with him said, "We can't attack those people; they are stronger than we are."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.32">And they spread among the Israelites a bad report about the land they had explored. They said, "The land we explored devours those living in it. All the people we saw there are of great size.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.33">We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them."</verse>

      <title type="sub">The People Rebel</title>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.1">That night all the members of the community raised their voices and wept aloud.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.2">All the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron, and the whole assembly said to them, "If only we had died in Egypt! Or in this wilderness!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.3">Why is Yahweh bringing us to this land only to let us fall by the sword? Our wives and children will be taken as plunder. Wouldn't it be better for us to go back to Egypt?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.4">And they said to each other, "We should choose a leader and go back to Egypt."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.5">Then Moses and Aaron fell facedown in front of the whole Israelite assembly gathered there.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.6">Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had explored the land, tore their clothes</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.7">and said to the entire Israelite assembly, "The land we passed through and explored is exceedingly good.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.8">If Yahweh is pleased with us, he will lead us into that land, a land flowing with milk and honey, and will give it to us.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.9">Only do not rebel against Yahweh. And do not be afraid of the people of the land, because we will devour them. Their protection is gone, but Yahweh is with us. Do not be afraid of them."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.10">But the whole assembly talked about stoning them. Then the glory of Yahweh appeared at the tent of meeting to all the Israelites.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.11">Yahweh said to Moses, "How long will these people treat me with contempt? How long will they refuse to believe in me, in spite of all the signs I have performed among them?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.12">I will strike them down with a plague and destroy them, but I will make you into a nation greater and stronger than they."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.13">Moses said to Yahweh, "Then the Egyptians will hear about it! By your power you brought these people up from among them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.14">And they will tell the inhabitants of this land about it. They have already heard that you, Yahweh, are with these people and that you, Yahweh, have been seen face to face, that your cloud stays over them, and that you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.15">If you put all these people to death, leaving none alive, the nations who have heard this report about you will say,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.16">'Yahweh was not able to bring these people into the land he promised them on oath, so he slaughtered them in the wilderness.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.17">Now may Yahweh's strength be displayed, just as you have declared:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.18">'Yahweh is slow to anger, abounding in love and forgiving wrongdoing and rebellion. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children for the wrongdoing of the parents to the third and fourth generation.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.19">In accordance with your great love, forgive the wrongdoing of these people, just as you have pardoned them from the time they left Egypt until now."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.20">Yahweh replied, "I have forgiven them, as you asked.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.21">Nevertheless, as surely as I live and as surely as the glory of Yahweh fills the whole earth,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.22">not one of those who saw my glory and the signs I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness but who disobeyed me and tested me ten times—</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.23">not one of them will ever see the land I promised on oath to their ancestors. No one who has treated me with contempt will ever see it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.24">But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me wholeheartedly, I will bring him into the land he went to, and his descendants will inherit it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.25">Since the Amalekites and the Canaanites are living in the valleys, turn back tomorrow and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.26">Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.27">"How long will this wicked community grumble against me? I have heard the complaints of these grumbling Israelites.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.28">So tell them, 'As surely as I live, declares Yahweh, I will do to you the very thing I heard you say:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.29">In this wilderness your bodies will fall—every one of you twenty years old or more who was counted in the census and who has grumbled against me.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.30">Not one of you will enter the land I swore with uplifted hand to make your home, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.31">As for your children that you said would be taken as plunder, I will bring them in to enjoy the land you have rejected.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.32">But as for you, your bodies will fall in this wilderness.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.33">Your children will be shepherds here for forty years, suffering for your unfaithfulness, until the last of your bodies lies in the wilderness.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.34">For forty years—one year for each of the forty days you explored the land—you will suffer for your wrongdoing and know what it is like to have me against you.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.35">I, Yahweh, have spoken, and I will surely do these things to this whole wicked community, which has banded together against me. They will meet their end in this wilderness; here they will die."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.36">So the men Moses had sent to explore the land, who returned and made the whole community grumble against him by spreading a bad report about it—</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.37">these men who were responsible for spreading the bad report about the land were struck down and died of a plague before Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.38">Of the men who went to explore the land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh survived.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.39">When Moses reported this to all the Israelites, they mourned bitterly.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.40">Early the next morning they set out for the highest point in the hill country, saying, "Now we are ready to go up to the land Yahweh promised. Surely we have been doing wrong!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.41">But Moses said, "Why are you disobeying Yahweh's command? This will not succeed!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.42">Do not go up, because Yahweh is not with you. You will be defeated by your enemies,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.43">for the Amalekites and the Canaanites will face you there. Because you have turned away from Yahweh, he will not be with you and you will fall by the sword."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.44">Nevertheless, in their presumption they went up toward the highest point in the hill country, though neither Moses nor the ark of Yahweh's covenant moved from the camp.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.45">Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down and attacked them and beat them down all the way to Hormah.</verse>
