      <title type="sub">The Levites</title>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.1">This is the account of the family of Aaron and Moses at the time Yahweh spoke with Moses at Mount Sinai.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.2">The names of the sons of Aaron were Nadab the firstborn and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.3">Those were the names of Aaron's sons, the priests with oil poured on them, who were ordained to serve as priests.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.4">Nadab and Abihu, however, died before Yahweh when they made an offering with unauthorized fire before him in the Desert of Sinai. They had no sons, so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during the lifetime of their father Aaron.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.5">Yahweh said to Moses,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.6">"Bring the tribe of Levi and present them to Aaron the priest to assist him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.7">They are to perform duties for him and for the whole community at the tent of meeting by doing the work of the tabernacle.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.8">They are to take care of all the furnishings of the tent of meeting, fulfilling the obligations of the Israelites by doing the work of the tabernacle.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.9">Give the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they are the Israelites who are to be given wholly to him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.10">Appoint Aaron and his sons to serve as priests; anyone else who approaches the sanctuary is to be put to death."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.11">Yahweh also said to Moses,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.12">"I have taken the Levites from among the Israelites in place of the first male offspring of every Israelite woman. The Levites are mine,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.13">for all the firstborn are mine. When I struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, I set apart for myself every firstborn in Israel, whether human or animal. They are to be mine. I am Yahweh."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.14">Yahweh said to Moses in the Desert of Sinai,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.15">"Count the Levites by their families and clans. Count every male a month old or more."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.16">So Moses counted them, as he was commanded by the word of Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.17">These were the names of the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.18">These were the names of the Gershonite clans: Libni and Shimei.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.19">The Kohathite clans: Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.20">The Merarite clans: Mahli and Mushi. These were the Levite clans, according to their families.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.21">To Gershon belonged the clans of the Libnites and Shimeites; these were the Gershonite clans.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.22">The number of all the males a month old or more who were counted was 7,500.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.23">The Gershonite clans were to camp on the west, behind the tabernacle.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.24">The leader of the families of the Gershonites was Eliasaph son of Lael.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.25">At the tent of meeting the Gershonites were responsible for the care of the tabernacle and tent, its coverings, the curtain at the entrance to the tent of meeting,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.26">the curtains of the courtyard, the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard surrounding the tabernacle and altar, and the ropes—and everything related to their use.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.27">To Kohath belonged the clans of the Amramites, Izharites, Hebronites and Uzzielites; these were the Kohathite clans.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.28">The number of all the males a month old or more was 8,600. The Kohathites were responsible for the care of the sanctuary.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.29">The Kohathite clans were to camp on the south side of the tabernacle.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.30">The leader of the families of the Kohathite clans was Elizaphan son of Uzziel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.31">They were responsible for the care of the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the articles of the sanctuary used in ministering, the curtain, and everything related to their use.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.32">The chief leader of the Levites was Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest. He was appointed over those who were responsible for the care of the sanctuary.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.33">To Merari belonged the clans of the Mahlites and the Mushites; these were the Merarite clans.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.34">The number of all the males a month old or more who were counted was 6,200.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.35">The leader of the families of the Merarite clans was Zuriel son of Abihail; they were to camp on the north side of the tabernacle.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.36">The Merarites were appointed to take care of the frames of the tabernacle, its crossbars, posts, bases, all its equipment, and everything related to their use,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.37">as well as the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs and ropes.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.38">Moses and Aaron and his sons were to camp to the east of the tabernacle, toward the sunrise, in front of the tent of meeting. They were responsible for the care of the sanctuary on behalf of the Israelites. Anyone else who approached the sanctuary was to be put to death.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.39">The total number of Levites counted at Yahweh's command by Moses and Aaron according to their clans, including every male a month old or more, was 22,000.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.40">Yahweh said to Moses, "Count all the firstborn Israelite males who are a month old or more and make a list of their names.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.41">Take the Levites for me in place of all the firstborn of the Israelites, and the livestock of the Levites in place of all the firstborn of the livestock of the Israelites. I am Yahweh."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.42">So Moses counted all the firstborn of the Israelites, as Yahweh commanded him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.43">The total number of firstborn males a month old or more, listed by name, was 22,273.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.44">Yahweh also said to Moses,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.45">"Take the Levites in place of all the firstborn of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites in place of their livestock. The Levites are to be mine. I am Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.46">To buy back the 273 firstborn Israelites who exceed the number of the Levites,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.47">collect five shekels for each one, according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.48">Give the money for the redemption of the additional Israelites to Aaron and his sons."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.49">So Moses collected the money for buying back from those who exceeded the number bought back by the Levites.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.50">From the firstborn of the Israelites he collected silver weighing 1,365 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.51">Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and his sons, as he was commanded by the word of Yahweh.</verse>

      <title type="sub">The Kohathites</title>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.1">Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.2">"Take a census of the Kohathite branch of the Levites by their clans and families.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.3">Count all the men from thirty to fifty years of age who come to serve in the work at the tent of meeting.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.4">This is the work of the Kohathites at the tent of meeting: the care of the most set apart things.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.5">When the camp is to move, Aaron and his sons are to go in and take down the shielding curtain and put it over the ark of the covenant law.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.6">Then they are to cover the curtain with a durable leather, spread a cloth of solid blue over that and put the poles in place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.7">Over the table of the Presence they are to spread a blue cloth and put on it the plates, dishes and bowls, and the jars for drink offerings; the bread that is continually there is to remain on it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.8">They are to spread a scarlet cloth over them, cover that with the durable leather and put the poles in place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.9">They are to take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand that is for light, together with its lamps, its wick trimmers and trays, and all its jars for the olive oil used to supply it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.10">Then they are to wrap it and all its accessories in a covering of the durable leather and put it on a carrying frame.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.11">Over the gold altar they are to spread a blue cloth and cover that with the durable leather and put the poles in place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.12">They are to take all the articles used for ministering in the sanctuary, wrap them in a blue cloth, cover that with the durable leather and put them on a carrying frame.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.13">They are to remove the ashes from the bronze altar and spread a purple cloth over it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.14">Then they are to place on it all the utensils used for ministering at the altar, including the firepans, meat forks, shovels and sprinkling bowls. Over it they are to spread a covering of the durable leather and put the poles in place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.15">After Aaron and his sons have finished covering the set apart furnishings and all the set apart articles, and when the camp is ready to move, only then are the Kohathites to come and do the carrying. But they must not touch the set apart things or they will die. The Kohathites are to carry those things that are in the tent of meeting.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.16">Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, is to have charge of the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the regular grain offering and the anointing oil. He is in charge of the entire tabernacle and everything in it, including its set apart furnishings and articles."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.4.17">Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron,</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.4.20">But the Kohathites must not go in to look at the set apart things, even for a moment, or they will die."</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.5.16">The priest shall bring her and have her stand before Yahweh.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.5.23">The priest is to write these curses on a scroll and then wash them off into the bitter water.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.11.11">He asked Yahweh, "Why have you brought this trouble on your servant? What have I done to displease you that you put the burden of all these people on me?</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.11.17">I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take some of the power of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them. They will share the burden of the people with you so that you will not have to carry it alone.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.11.18">Tell the people: 'Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow, when you will eat meat. Yahweh heard you when you wailed, "If only we had meat to eat! We were better off in Egypt!" Now Yahweh will give you meat, and you will eat it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.11.19">You will not eat it for just one day, or two days, or five, ten or twenty days,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.11.20">but for a whole month—until it comes out of your nostrils and you loathe it—because you have rejected Yahweh, who is among you, and have wailed before him, saying, "Why did we ever leave Egypt?"'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.11.21">But Moses said, "Here I am among six hundred thousand men on foot, and you say, 'I will give them meat to eat for a whole month!'</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.11.25">Then Yahweh came down in the cloud and spoke with him, and he took some of the power of the Spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied—but did not do so again.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.11.26">However, two men, whose names were Eldad and Medad, had remained in the camp. They were listed among the elders, but did not go out to the tent. Yet the Spirit also rested on them, and they prophesied in the camp.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.13.5">from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.6">from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.7">from the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.8">from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.9">from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.10">from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.11">from the tribe of Manasseh (a tribe of Joseph), Gaddi son of Susi;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.12">from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.13">from the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael;</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.13.15">from the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Maki.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.16">These are the names of the men Moses sent to explore the land. (Moses gave Hoshea son of Nun the name Joshua.)</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.17">When Moses sent them to explore Canaan, he said, "Go up through the Negev and on into the hill country.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.18">See what the land is like and whether the people who live there are strong or weak, few or many.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.19">What kind of land do they live in? Is it good or bad? What kind of towns do they live in? Are they unwalled or fortified?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.20">How is the soil? Is it fertile or poor? Are there trees in it or not? Do your best to bring back some of the fruit of the land." (It was the season for the first ripe grapes.)</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.21">So they went up and explored the land from the Desert of Zin as far as Rehob, toward Lebo Hamath.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.22">They went up through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, lived. (Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.23">When they reached the Valley of Eshkol, they cut off a branch bearing a single cluster of grapes. Two of them carried it on a pole between them, along with some pomegranates and figs.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.24">That place was called the Valley of Eshkol because of the cluster of grapes the Israelites cut off there.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.25">At the end of forty days they returned from exploring the land.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.26">They came back to Moses and Aaron and the whole Israelite community at Kadesh in the Desert of Paran. There they reported to them and to the whole assembly and showed them the fruit of the land.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.27">They gave Moses this account: "We went into the land to which you sent us, and it does flow with milk and honey! Here is its fruit.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.28">But the people who live there are powerful, and the cities are fortified and very large. We even saw descendants of Anak there.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.29">The Amalekites live in the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites and Amorites live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live near the sea and along the Jordan."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.30">Then Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, "We should go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly do it."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.31">But the men who had gone up with him said, "We can't attack those people; they are stronger than we are."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.32">And they spread among the Israelites a bad report about the land they had explored. They said, "The land we explored devours those living in it. All the people we saw there are of great size.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.13.33">We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them."</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.14.3">Why is Yahweh bringing us to this land only to let us fall by the sword? Our wives and children will be taken as plunder. Wouldn't it be better for us to go back to Egypt?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.4">And they said to each other, "We should choose a leader and go back to Egypt."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.5">Then Moses and Aaron fell facedown in front of the whole Israelite assembly gathered there.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.6">Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had explored the land, tore their clothes</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.14.10">But the whole assembly talked about stoning them. Then the glory of Yahweh appeared at the tent of meeting to all the Israelites.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.11">Yahweh said to Moses, "How long will these people treat me with contempt? How long will they refuse to believe in me, in spite of all the signs I have performed among them?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.12">I will strike them down with a plague and destroy them, but I will make you into a nation greater and stronger than they."</verse>

They have already heard that you, Yahweh, are with these people and that you, Yahweh, have been seen face to face, that your cloud stays over them, and that you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.15">If you put all these people to death, leaving none alive, the nations who have heard this report about you will say,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.16">'Yahweh was not able to bring these people into the land he promised them on oath, so he slaughtered them in the wilderness.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.17">Now may Yahweh's strength be displayed, just as you have declared:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.18">'Yahweh is slow to anger, abounding in love and forgiving wrongdoing and rebellion. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children for the wrongdoing of the parents to the third and fourth generation.'</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.14.20">Yahweh replied, "I have forgiven them, as you asked.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.14.31">As for your children that you said would be taken as plunder, I will bring them in to enjoy the land you have rejected.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.32">But as for you, your bodies will fall in this wilderness.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.33">Your children will be shepherds here for forty years, suffering for your unfaithfulness, until the last of your bodies lies in the wilderness.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.34">For forty years—one year for each of the forty days you explored the land—you will suffer for your wrongdoing and know what it is like to have me against you.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.35">I, Yahweh, have spoken, and I will surely do these things to this whole wicked community, which has banded together against me. They will meet their end in this wilderness; here they will die."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.14.36">So the men Moses had sent to explore the land, who returned and made the whole community grumble against him by spreading a bad report about it—</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.16.9">Isn't it enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the Israelite community and brought you near himself to do the work at Yahweh's tabernacle and to stand before the community and minister to them?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.16.10">He has brought you and all your fellow Levites near himself, but now you are trying to get the priesthood too.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.16.11">It is against Yahweh that you and all your followers have banded together. Who is Aaron that you should grumble against him?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.16.12">Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab. But they said, "We will not come!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.16.13">Isn't it enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness? And now you also want to lord it over us!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.16.14">Moreover, you haven't brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Do you want to treat these men like slaves? No, we will not come!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.16.15">Then Moses became very angry and said to Yahweh, "Do not accept their offering. I have not taken so much as a donkey from them, nor have I wronged any of them."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.16.16">Moses said to Korah, "You and all your followers are to appear before Yahweh tomorrow—you and they and Aaron.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.16.22">But Moses and Aaron fell facedown and cried out, "O God, the God who gives breath to all living things, will you be angry with the entire assembly when only one man commits wrongdoing?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.16.23">Then Yahweh said to Moses,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.16.24">"Say to the assembly, 'Move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram.'"</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.16.30">But if Yahweh brings about something totally new, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them, with everything that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the realm of the dead, then you will know that these men have treated Yahweh with contempt."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.16.31">As soon as he finished saying all this, the ground under them split apart</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.16.32">and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them and their households, and all those associated with Korah, together with their possessions.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.16.33">They went down alive into the realm of the dead, with everything they owned; the earth closed over them, and they perished and were gone from the community.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.16.34">At their cries, all the Israelites around them fled, shouting, "The earth is going to swallow us too!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.16.35">And fire came out from Yahweh and consumed the 250 men who were offering the incense.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.16.36">Yahweh said to Moses,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.16.37">"Tell Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, to remove the censers from the charred remains and scatter the coals some distance away, for the censers are set apart—</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.16.38">the censers of the men who have committed wrongdoing at the cost of their lives. Hammer the censers into sheets to overlay the altar, for they were presented before Yahweh and have become set apart. Let them be a sign to the Israelites."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.16.39">So Eleazar the priest collected the bronze censers brought by those who had been burned to death, and he had them hammered out to overlay the altar,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.16.40">as Yahweh directed him through Moses. This was to remind the Israelites that no one except a descendant of Aaron should come to burn incense before Yahweh, or he would become like Korah and his followers.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.19.3">Give it to Eleazar the priest; it is to be taken outside the camp and slaughtered in his presence.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.19.9">A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and put them in a ceremonially clean place outside the camp. They are to be kept by the Israelite community for use in the water of cleansing; it is for purification from wrongdoing.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.19.10">The man who gathers up the ashes of the heifer must also wash his clothes, and he too will be unclean till evening. This will be a lasting ordinance both for the Israelites and for the foreigners residing among them.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.22.6">Now come and put a curse on these people, because they are too powerful for me. Perhaps then I will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land. For I know that whoever you bless is blessed, and whoever you curse is cursed."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.7">The elders of Moab and Midian left, taking with them the fee for divination. When they came to Balaam, they told him what Balak had said.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.8">"Spend the night here," Balaam said to them, "and I will report back to you with whatever Yahweh tells me." So the Moabite officials stayed with Balaam.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.9">God came to Balaam and asked, "Who are these men with you?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.10">Balaam said to God, "Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent me this message:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.11">'A people that has come out of Egypt covers the face of the land. Now come and put a curse on them for me. Perhaps then I will be able to fight them and drive them away.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.12">But God said to Balaam, "Do not go with them. You must not put a curse on those people, because they are blessed."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.13">The next morning Balaam got up and said to Balak's officials, "Go back to your own country, for Yahweh has refused to let me go with you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.14">So the Moabite officials returned to Balak and said, "Balaam refused to come with us."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.15">Then Balak sent other officials, more numerous and more distinguished than the first.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.16">They came to Balaam and said: "This is what Balak son of Zippor says: Do not let anything keep you from coming to me,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.17">because I will reward you handsomely and do whatever you say. Come and put a curse on these people for me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.18">But Balaam answered them, "Even if Balak gave me all the silver and gold in his palace, I could not do anything great or small to go beyond the command of Yahweh my God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.19">Now spend the night here so that I can find out what else Yahweh will tell me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.20">That night God came to Balaam and said, "Since these men have come to summon you, go with them, but do only what I tell you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.21">Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey and went with the Moabite officials.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.22">But God was very angry when he went, and the angel of Yahweh stood in the road to oppose him. Balaam was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.23">When the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand, it turned off the road into a field. Balaam beat it to get it back on the road.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.24">Then the angel of Yahweh stood in a narrow path through the vineyards, with walls on both sides.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.25">When the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, it pressed close to the wall, crushing Balaam's foot against it. So he beat the donkey again.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.26">Then the angel of Yahweh moved on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn, either to the right or to the left.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.27">When the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, it lay down under Balaam, and he was angry and beat it with his staff.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.28">Then Yahweh opened the donkey's mouth, and it said to Balaam, "What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.29">Balaam answered the donkey, "You have made a fool of me! If only I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.30">The donkey said to Balaam, "Am I not your own donkey, which you have always ridden, to this day? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?" "No," he said.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.31">Then Yahweh opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the road with his sword drawn. So he bowed low and fell facedown.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.32">The angel of Yahweh asked him, "Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? I have come here to oppose you because your path is a reckless one before me.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.33">The donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If it had not turned away, I would certainly have killed you by now, but I would have spared it."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.34">Balaam said to the angel of Yahweh, "I have sinned. I did not realize you were standing in the road to oppose me. Now if you are displeased, I will go back."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.35">The angel of Yahweh said to Balaam, "Go with the men, but speak only what I tell you." So Balaam went with Balak's officials.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.36">When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the Moabite town on the Arnon border, at the edge of his territory.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.37">Balak said to Balaam, "Did I not send you an urgent summons? Why didn't you come to me? Am I really not able to reward you?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.38">"Well, I have come to you now," Balaam replied. "But I can't say whatever I please. I must speak only what God puts in my mouth."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.39">Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath Huzoth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.40">Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and gave some to Balaam and the officials who were with him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.22.41">The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth Baal, and from there he could see the outskirts of the Israelite camp.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.23.3">Then Balaam said to Balak, "Stay here beside your burnt offering while I go aside. Perhaps Yahweh will come to meet with me. Whatever he reveals to me I will tell you." Then he went off to a barren height.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.23.14">So he took him to the field of Zophim on the top of Pisgah, and there he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.</verse>

      <title type="sub">Inheritance of Zelophehad's Daughters</title>
      <verse osisID="Num.36.1">The family heads of the clan of Gilead son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, who were from the clans of the descendants of Joseph, came and spoke before Moses and the leaders, the heads of the Israelite families.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.36.2">They said, "When Yahweh commanded my lord to give the land as an inheritance to the Israelites by lot, he ordered you to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.36.3">Now suppose they marry men from other Israelite tribes; then their inheritance will be taken from our ancestral inheritance and added to that of the tribe they marry into. And so part of the inheritance allotted to us will be taken away.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.36.4">When the Year of Jubilee for the Israelites comes, their inheritance will be added to that of the tribe into which they marry, and their property will be taken from the tribal inheritance of our ancestors."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.36.5">Then at Yahweh's command Moses gave this order to the Israelites: "What the tribe of the descendants of Joseph is saying is right.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.36.6">This is what Yahweh commands for Zelophehad's daughters: They may marry anyone they please as long as they marry within their father's tribal clan.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.36.7">No inheritance in Israel is to pass from one tribe to another, for every Israelite shall keep the tribal inheritance of their ancestors.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.36.8">Every daughter who inherits land in any Israelite tribe must marry someone in her father's tribal clan, so that every Israelite will possess the inheritance of their ancestors.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.36.9">No inheritance may pass from one tribe to another, for each Israelite tribe is to keep the land it inherits."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.36.10">So Zelophehad's daughters did as Yahweh commanded Moses.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.36.11">Zelophehad's daughters—Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milkah and Noah—married their cousins on their father's side.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.36.12">They married within the clans of the descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in their father's tribe and clan.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.36.13">These are the commands and regulations Yahweh gave through Moses to the Israelites on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.</verse>
