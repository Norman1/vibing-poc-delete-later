      <verse osisID="Num.1.1">Yahweh spoke to Moses in the tent of meeting in the Desert of Sinai on the first day of the second month of the second year after the Israelites came out of Egypt. He said:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.1.2">"Take a census of the whole Israelite community by their clans and families, listing every man by name, one by one.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.1.3">You and Aaron are to count according to their divisions all the men in Israel twenty years old or more who are able to serve in the army.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.1.51">Whenever the tabernacle is to move, the Levites are to take it down, and whenever the tabernacle is to be set up, the Levites shall do it. Anyone else who approaches it is to be put to death.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Num.1.53">The Levites, however, are to set up their tents around the tabernacle of the covenant law so that my wrath will not fall on the Israelite community. The Levites are to be responsible for the care of the tabernacle of the covenant law."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.1.54">The Israelites did all this just as Yahweh commanded Moses.</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Num.3" sID="Num.3"/>
      <title type="sub">The Levites</title>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.1">This is the account of the family of Aaron and Moses at the time Yahweh spoke with Moses at Mount Sinai.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.2">The names of the sons of Aaron were Nadab the firstborn and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.3">Those were the names of Aaron's sons, the anointed priests, who were ordained to serve as priests.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.4">Nadab and Abihu, however, died before Yahweh when they made an offering with unauthorized fire before him in the Desert of Sinai. They had no sons, so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during the lifetime of their father Aaron.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.5">Yahweh said to Moses,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.6">"Bring the tribe of Levi and present them to Aaron the priest to assist him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.7">They are to perform duties for him and for the whole community at the tent of meeting by doing the work of the tabernacle.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.8">They are to take care of all the furnishings of the tent of meeting, fulfilling the obligations of the Israelites by doing the work of the tabernacle.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.9">Give the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they are the Israelites who are to be given wholly to him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.10">Appoint Aaron and his sons to serve as priests; anyone else who approaches the sanctuary is to be put to death."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.11">Yahweh also said to Moses,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.12">"I have taken the Levites from among the Israelites in place of the first male offspring of every Israelite woman. The Levites are mine,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.13">for all the firstborn are mine. When I struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, I set apart for myself every firstborn in Israel, whether human or animal. They are to be mine. I am Yahweh."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.14">Yahweh said to Moses in the Desert of Sinai,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.15">"Count the Levites by their families and clans. Count every male a month old or more."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.16">So Moses counted them, as he was commanded by the word of Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.17">These were the names of the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.18">These were the names of the Gershonite clans: Libni and Shimei.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.19">The Kohathite clans: Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.20">The Merarite clans: Mahli and Mushi. These were the Levite clans, according to their families.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.21">To Gershon belonged the clans of the Libnites and Shimeites; these were the Gershonite clans.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.22">The number of all the males a month old or more who were counted was 7,500.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.23">The Gershonite clans were to camp on the west, behind the tabernacle.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.24">The leader of the families of the Gershonites was Eliasaph son of Lael.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.25">At the tent of meeting the Gershonites were responsible for the care of the tabernacle and tent, its coverings, the curtain at the entrance to the tent of meeting,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.26">the curtains of the courtyard, the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard surrounding the tabernacle and altar, and the ropes—and everything related to their use.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.27">To Kohath belonged the clans of the Amramites, Izharites, Hebronites and Uzzielites; these were the Kohathite clans.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.28">The number of all the males a month old or more was 8,600. The Kohathites were responsible for the care of the sanctuary.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.29">The Kohathite clans were to camp on the south side of the tabernacle.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.30">The leader of the families of the Kohathite clans was Elizaphan son of Uzziel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.31">They were responsible for the care of the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the articles of the sanctuary used in ministering, the curtain, and everything related to their use.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.32">The chief leader of the Levites was Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest. He was appointed over those who were responsible for the care of the sanctuary.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.33">To Merari belonged the clans of the Mahlites and the Mushites; these were the Merarite clans.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.34">The number of all the males a month old or more who were counted was 6,200.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.35">The leader of the families of the Merarite clans was Zuriel son of Abihail; they were to camp on the north side of the tabernacle.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.36">The Merarites were appointed to take care of the frames of the tabernacle, its crossbars, posts, bases, all its equipment, and everything related to their use,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.37">as well as the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs and ropes.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.38">Moses and Aaron and his sons were to camp to the east of the tabernacle, toward the sunrise, in front of the tent of meeting. They were responsible for the care of the sanctuary on behalf of the Israelites. Anyone else who approached the sanctuary was to be put to death.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.39">The total number of Levites counted at Yahweh's command by Moses and Aaron according to their clans, including every male a month old or more, was 22,000.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.40">Yahweh said to Moses, "Count all the firstborn Israelite males who are a month old or more and make a list of their names.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.41">Take the Levites for me in place of all the firstborn of the Israelites, and the livestock of the Levites in place of all the firstborn of the livestock of the Israelites. I am Yahweh."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.42">So Moses counted all the firstborn of the Israelites, as Yahweh commanded him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.43">The total number of firstborn males a month old or more, listed by name, was 22,273.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.44">Yahweh also said to Moses,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.45">"Take the Levites in place of all the firstborn of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites in place of their livestock. The Levites are to be mine. I am Yahweh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.46">To redeem the 273 firstborn Israelites who exceed the number of the Levites,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.47">collect five shekels for each one, according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.48">Give the money for the redemption of the additional Israelites to Aaron and his sons."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.49">So Moses collected the redemption money from those who exceeded the number redeemed by the Levites.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.50">From the firstborn of the Israelites he collected silver weighing 1,365 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Num.3.51">Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and his sons, as he was commanded by the word of Yahweh.</verse>
