      <chapter osisID="Jude.1" sID="Jude.1"/>
      <title type="main">Greeting</title>
      <verse osisID="Jude.1.1">Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ<note type="translation">The Greek word "Christ" means "Anointed One" or "Messiah"</note> and a brother of James, to those who have been called, who are loved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jude.1.2">Mercy, peace and love be yours in abundance.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Sin and Doom of Ungodly People</title>
      <verse osisID="Jude.1.3">Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share, I felt compelled to write and urge you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to God's people<note type="translation">The Greek word "hagios" means holy ones or those set apart for God</note>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jude.1.4">For certain individuals whose condemnation was written about long ago have secretly slipped in among you. They are ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign and Lord.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jude.1.5">Though you already know all this, I want to remind you that the Lord<note type="translation">Some manuscripts read "Jesus" here instead of "Lord"</note> at one time delivered his people out of Egypt, but later destroyed those who did not believe.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jude.1.6">And the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their proper dwelling—these he has kept in darkness, bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great Day.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jude.1.7">In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jude.1.8">In the very same way, on the strength of their dreams these ungodly people pollute their own bodies, reject authority and heap abuse on celestial beings.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jude.1.9">But even the archangel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses, did not himself dare to condemn him for slander but said, "The Lord rebuke you!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jude.1.10">Yet these people slander whatever they do not understand, and the very things they do understand by instinct—as irrational animals do—will destroy them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jude.1.11">What sorrow awaits them! They have taken the way of Cain; they have rushed for profit into Balaam's error; they have been destroyed in Korah's rebellion.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jude.1.12">These people are blemishes at your love feasts, eating with you without the slightest qualm—shepherds who feed only themselves. They are clouds without rain, blown along by the wind; autumn trees, without fruit and uprooted—twice dead.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jude.1.13">They are wild waves of the sea, foaming up their shame; wandering stars, for whom blackest darkness has been reserved forever.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jude.1.14">Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about them: "See, the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his set apart ones<note type="translation">The Greek word "hagios" means holy ones or those set apart for God</note></verse>
      <verse osisID="Jude.1.15">to judge everyone, and to convict all of them of all the ungodly acts they have committed in their ungodliness, and of all the defiant words ungodly sinners have spoken against him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jude.1.16">These people are grumblers and faultfinders; they follow their own evil desires; they boast about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage.</verse>
      <title type="sub">A Call to Persevere</title>
      <verse osisID="Jude.1.17">But, dear friends, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jude.1.18">They said to you, "In the last times there will be scoffers who will follow their own ungodly desires."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jude.1.19">These are the people who divide you, who follow mere natural instincts and do not have the Spirit.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jude.1.20">But you, dear friends, by building yourselves up in your most set apart faith<note type="translation">The Greek word "hagios" means holy or set apart</note> and praying in the Holy Spirit,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jude.1.21">keep yourselves in God's love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jude.1.22">Be merciful to those who doubt;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jude.1.23">save others by snatching them from the fire; to others show mercy, mixed with fear—hating even the clothing stained by corrupted flesh.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Doxology</title>
      <verse osisID="Jude.1.24">To him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy—</verse>
      <verse osisID="Jude.1.25">to the only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power and authority, through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now and forevermore! Amen.</verse>
