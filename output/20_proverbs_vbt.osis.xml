      <verse osisID="Prov.1.1">The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.2">To know wisdom and instruction, to understand words of insight,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.3">to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness, justice, and fairness;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.4">to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the young—</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.5">Let the wise hear and increase in learning, and the one who understands obtain guidance,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.6">to understand a proverb and a saying, the words of the wise and their riddles.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.7">The fear of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">A Father's Warning Against Evil Companions</title>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.8">Hear, my son, your father's instruction, and do not forsake your mother's teaching,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.9">for they are a graceful wreath for your head and pendants for your neck.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.10">My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.11">If they say, "Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood; let us ambush the innocent without reason;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.12">let us swallow them alive, like Sheol, and whole, like those who go down to the pit;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.13">we shall find all precious goods, we shall fill our houses with plunder;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.14">throw in your lot among us; we will all have one purse"—</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.15">my son, do not walk in the way with them; hold back your foot from their paths,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.16">for their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.17">For in vain is a net spread in the sight of any bird,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.18">but these men lie in wait for their own blood; they set an ambush for their own lives.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.19">Such are the ways of everyone who is greedy for unjust gain; it takes away the life of its possessors.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Wisdom's Warning</title>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.20">Wisdom cries aloud in the street, in the markets she raises her voice;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.21">at the head of the noisy streets she cries out; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.22">"How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple? How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools hate knowledge?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.23">If you turn at my reproof, behold, I will pour out my spirit to you; I will make my words known to you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.24">Because I have called and you refused to listen, have stretched out my hand and no one has heeded,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.25">because you have ignored all my counsel and would have none of my reproof,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.26">I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when terror strikes you,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.27">when terror strikes you like a storm and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.28">Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently but will not find me.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.29">Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.30">would have none of my counsel and despised all my reproof,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.31">therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way, and have their fill of their own devices.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.32">For the simple are killed by their turning away, and the complacency of fools destroys them;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.1.33">but whoever listens to me will dwell secure and will be at ease, without dread of disaster."</verse>

      <verse osisID="Prov.2.1">My son, if you receive my words and treasure up my commandments with you,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.2.2">making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to understanding;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.2.3">yes, if you call out for insight and raise your voice for understanding,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.2.4">if you seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.2.5">then you will understand the fear of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> and find the knowledge of God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.2.6">For <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.2.7">he stores up sound wisdom for the upright; he is a shield to those who walk in integrity,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.2.8">guarding the paths of justice and watching over the way of his saints.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.2.9">Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity, every good path;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.2.10">for wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.2.11">discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.2.12">delivering you from the way of evil, from men of perverted speech,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.2.13">who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.2.14">who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perverseness of evil,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.2.15">men whose paths are crooked, and who are devious in their ways.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.2.16">So you will be delivered from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.2.17">who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.2.18">for her house sinks down to death, and her paths to the departed;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.2.19">none who go to her come back, nor do they regain the paths of life.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.2.20">So you will walk in the way of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.2.21">For the upright will inhabit the land, and those with integrity will remain in it,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.2.22">but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous will be rooted out of it.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Prov.3.3">Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you; bind them around your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Prov.3.9">Honor <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your produce;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.3.10">then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will be bursting with wine.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.3.11">My son, do not despise <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>'s discipline or be weary of his reproof,</verse>

      <verse osisID="Prov.3.17">Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.3.18">She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her; those who hold her fast are called blessed.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Prov.3.21">My son, do not lose sight of these— keep sound wisdom and discretion,</verse>

      <verse osisID="Prov.3.24">If you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.3.25">Do not be afraid of sudden terror or of the ruin of the wicked, when it comes,</verse>

      <verse osisID="Prov.3.31">Do not envy a man of violence and do not choose any of his ways,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.3.32">for the devious person is an abomination to <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, but the upright are in his confidence.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Prov.6.5">save yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the hand of the fowler.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">The Example of the Ant</title>
      <verse osisID="Prov.6.6">Go to the ant, O sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.6.7">Without having any chief, officer, or ruler,</verse>

      <title type="sub">The Worthless Person</title>
      <verse osisID="Prov.6.12">A worthless person, a wicked man, goes about with crooked speech,</verse>

      <verse osisID="Prov.6.14">with perverted heart devises evil, continually sowing discord;</verse>

      <verse osisID="Prov.6.17">haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.6.18">a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.6.19">a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who sows discord among brothers.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Warning Against Adultery</title>
      <verse osisID="Prov.6.20">My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not your mother's teaching.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.6.21">Bind them on your heart always; tie them around your neck.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.6.22">When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk with you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.6.23">For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.6.24">to preserve you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the adulteress.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.6.25">Do not desire her beauty in your heart, and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.6.26">For the price of a prostitute is only a loaf of bread, but a married woman hunts down a precious life.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.6.27">Can a man carry fire next to his chest and his clothes not be burned?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.6.28">Or can one walk on hot coals and his feet not be scorched?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.6.29">So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife; none who touches her will go unpunished.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.6.30">People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his appetite when he is hungry,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.6.31">but if he is caught, he will pay sevenfold; he will give all the goods of his house.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.6.32">He who commits adultery lacks sense; he who does it destroys himself.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.6.33">He will get wounds and dishonor, and his disgrace will not be wiped away.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.6.34">For jealousy makes a man furious, and he will not spare when he takes revenge.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Prov.6.35">He will accept no compensation; he will refuse though you multiply gifts.</verse>
