      <title type="sub">The Vision of Isaiah - God's Case Against Judah</title>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.1">The vision of Isaiah son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.2">Listen, heavens, and give ear, earth, for <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> has spoken: "I raised children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.3">An ox knows its owner, and a donkey its master's feeding trough, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.4">Terrible sorrow to the sinful nation, a people loaded down with guilt, offspring of evildoers, children who act corruptly! They have abandoned <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, they have despised the One Set Apart for God of Israel, they have turned away backward.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.5">Why would you be struck again? You would continue to rebel. The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.6">From the sole of the foot even to the head, there is no soundness in it, but wounds and bruises and festering sores; they have not been closed or bound up or softened with oil.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.7">Your country lies desolate, your cities are burned with fire; in your very presence foreigners devour your land, and it is desolate, as overthrown by foreigners.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.8">The daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a lodge in a cucumber field, like a besieged city.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.9">Unless <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> of hosts had left us a few survivors, we would have been like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.10">Hear the word of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, you rulers of Sodom! Give ear to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.11">"What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices?" says <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>. "I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of well-fed animals; I do not delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of goats.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.12">When you come to appear before me, who has required this of you, this trampling of my courts?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.13">Bring no more worthless offerings; incense is detestable to me. New moon and Sabbath and the calling of convocations—I cannot endure twisted wrongness and solemn assembly.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.14">Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates; they have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.15">When you spread out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.16">Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your deeds from before my eyes; cease to do evil,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.17">learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; bring justice to the fatherless, plead the widow's cause.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.18">"Come now, let us reason together," says <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>: "though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.19">If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.20">but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be eaten by the sword; for the mouth of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> has spoken."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.21">How the faithful city has become a prostitute! She who was full of justice! Righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.22">Your silver has become dross, your best wine mixed with water.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.23">Your princes are rebels and companions of thieves. Everyone loves a bribe and runs after gifts. They do not bring justice to the fatherless, and the widow's cause does not come to them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.24">Therefore the Lord declares, <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: "Ah, I will get relief from my adversaries and avenge myself on my enemies.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.25">I will turn my hand against you and will smelt away your dross as with lye and remove all your alloy.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.26">And I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you shall be called the city of doing what's right, the faithful city."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.27">Zion shall be bought back with justice, and those in her who change their minds with doing what's right.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.28">But rebels and sinners shall be broken together, and those who forsake <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> shall be consumed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.29">For they shall be ashamed of the oaks that you desired; and you shall blush for the gardens that you have chosen.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.30">For you shall be like an oak whose leaf withers, and like a garden without water.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.1.31">And the strong shall become tinder, and his work a spark, and both of them shall burn together, with none to quench them.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Isa.2.1">The word that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.2.2">It shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the house of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and shall be lifted up above the hills; and all the nations shall flow to it,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.2.3">and many peoples shall come, and say: "Come, let us go up to the mountain of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, to the house of the God of Jacob, that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths." For out of Zion shall go the law, and the word of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> from Jerusalem.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.2.4">He shall judge between the nations, and shall decide disputes for many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.</verse>

      <title type="sub">The Day of Yahweh's Judgment</title>
      <verse osisID="Isa.2.6">For you have rejected your people, the house of Jacob, because they are full of things from the east and of fortune-tellers like the Philistines, and they strike hands with the children of foreigners.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.2.7">Their land is filled with silver and gold, and there is no end to their treasures; their land is filled with horses, and there is no end to their chariots.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.2.8">Their land is filled with idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their own fingers have made.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.2.9">So man is humbled, and each one is brought low— do not forgive them!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.2.10">Enter into the rock and hide in the dust from before the terror of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, and from the splendor of his majesty.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.2.11">The haughty looks of man shall be brought low, and the lofty pride of men shall be humbled, and <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> alone will be exalted in that day.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.2.12">For <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> of hosts has a day against all that is proud and lofty, against all that is lifted up—and it shall be brought low;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.2.13">against all the cedars of Lebanon, lofty and lifted up; and against all the oaks of Bashan;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.2.14">against all the lofty mountains, and against all the uplifted hills;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.2.15">against every high tower, and against every fortified wall;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.2.16">against all the ships of Tarshish, and against all the beautiful craft.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.2.17">And the haughtiness of man shall be humbled, and the lofty pride of men shall be brought low, and <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> alone will be exalted in that day.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.2.18">And the idols shall utterly pass away.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.2.19">And people shall enter the caves of the rocks and the holes of the ground, from before the terror of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, and from the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.2.20">In that day mankind will cast away their idols of silver and their idols of gold, which they made for themselves to worship, to the moles and to the bats,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.2.21">to enter the caverns of the rocks and the clefts of the cliffs, from before the terror of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, and from the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Isa.3.4">And I will make boys their princes, and infants shall rule over them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.3.5">And the people will oppress one another, every one his fellow and every one his neighbor; the youth will be insolent to the elder, and the despised to the honorable.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.3.6">For a man will take hold of his brother in the house of his father, saying: "You have a cloak; you shall be our leader, and this heap of ruins shall be under your rule";</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.3.7">in that day he will speak out, saying: "I will not be a healer; in my house there is neither bread nor cloak; you shall not make me leader of the people."</verse>

      <verse osisID="Isa.61.1">The Spirit of the Lord <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> is upon me, because <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> has anointed me to bring good news to the poor; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.61.2">to proclaim the year of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>'s favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.61.3">to grant to those who mourn in Zion— to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit; that they may be called oaks of doing what's right, the planting of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, that he may be glorified.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.61.4">They shall build up the ancient ruins; they shall raise up the former devastations; they shall repair the ruined cities, the devastations of many generations.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.61.5">Strangers shall stand and tend your flocks; foreigners shall be your plowmen and vinedressers;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.61.6">but you shall be called the priests of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>; they shall speak of you as the ministers of our God; you shall eat the wealth of the nations, and in their glory you shall boast.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.61.7">Instead of your shame there shall be a double portion; instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their lot; therefore in their land they shall possess a double portion; they shall have everlasting joy.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.61.8">For I <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> love justice; I hate robbery and wrong; I will faithfully give them their recompense, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.61.9">Their offspring shall be known among the nations, and their descendants in the midst of the peoples; all who see them shall acknowledge them, that they are an offspring <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> has blessed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.61.10">I will greatly rejoice in <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>; my soul shall exult in my God, for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation; he has covered me with the robe of doing what's right, as a bridegroom decks himself like a priest with a beautiful headdress, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.61.11">For as the earth brings forth its sprouts, and as a garden causes what is sown in it to sprout up, so the Lord <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> will cause doing what's right and praise to sprout up before all the nations.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Isa.62.1">For Zion's sake I will not keep silent, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not be quiet, until her doing what's right goes forth as brightness, and her salvation as a burning torch.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.62.2">The nations shall see your doing what's right, and all the kings your glory, and you shall be called by a new name that the mouth of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> will give.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.62.3">You shall be a crown of beauty in the hand of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.62.4">You shall no more be termed Forsaken, and your land shall no more be termed Desolate, but you shall be called My Delight Is in Her, and your land Married; for <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> delights in you, and your land shall be married.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.62.5">For as a young man marries a young woman, so shall your sons marry you, and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.62.6">On your walls, O Jerusalem, I have set watchmen; all the day and all the night they shall never be silent. You who put <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> in remembrance, take no rest,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.62.7">and give him no rest until he establishes Jerusalem and makes it a praise in the earth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.62.10">Go through, go through the gates; prepare the way for the people; build up, build up the highway; clear it of stones; lift up a signal over the peoples.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.62.11">Behold, <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> has proclaimed to the end of the earth: Say to the daughter of Zion, "Behold, your salvation comes; behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.62.12">And they shall be called The Set Apart People, The Redeemed of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>; and you shall be called Sought Out, A City Not Forsaken.</verse>

      <title type="sub">The Lord's Day of Vengeance</title>
      <verse osisID="Isa.63.1">Who is this who comes from Edom, in crimsoned garments from Bozrah, he who is splendid in his apparel, marching in the greatness of his strength? "It is I, speaking in doing what's right, mighty to save."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.63.2">Why is your apparel red, and your garments like his who treads in the winepress?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.63.3">"I have trodden the winepress alone, and from the peoples no one was with me; I trod them in my anger and trampled them in my wrath; their lifeblood spattered on my garments, and stained all my apparel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.63.4">For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and my year of redemption had come.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.63.5">I looked, but there was no one to help; I was appalled, but there was no one to uphold; so my own arm brought me salvation, and my wrath upheld me.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.63.6">I trampled down the peoples in my anger; I made them drunk in my wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth."</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">The Lord's Mercy Remembered</title>
      <verse osisID="Isa.63.7">I will recount the steadfast loves of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, the praises of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, according to all that <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> has granted us, and the great goodness to the house of Israel that he has granted them according to his compassion, according to the abundance of his steadfast love.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.63.8">For he said, "Surely they are my people, children who will not deal falsely." And he became their Savior.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.63.9">In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them; in his love and in his pity he bought them back; he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.63.10">But they rebelled and grieved his Set Apart Spirit; therefore he turned to be their enemy, and himself fought against them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.63.16">For you are our Father, though Abraham does not know us, and Israel does not acknowledge us; you, O <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, are our Father, our Redeemer from of old is your name.</verse>

      <title type="sub">Prayer for Mercy</title>
      <verse osisID="Isa.64.1">Oh that you would rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains might quake at your presence—</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.64.2">as when fire kindles brushwood and the fire causes water to boil— to make your name known to your adversaries, and that the nations might tremble at your presence!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.64.3">When you did awesome things that we did not look for, you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.64.4">From of old no one has heard or perceived by the ear, no eye has seen a God besides you, who acts for those who wait for him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.64.5">You meet him who joyfully works doing what's right, those who remember you in your ways. Behold, you were angry, and we sinned; in our sins we have been a long time, and shall we be saved?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.64.6">We have all become like one who is unclean, and all our deeds of doing what's right are like a polluted garment. We all fade like a leaf, and our twisted wrongness, like the wind, take us away.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.64.7">There is no one who calls upon your name, who rouses himself to take hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us, and have made us melt in the hand of our twisted wrongness.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.64.8">But now, O <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you are our potter; we are all the work of your hand.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.64.9">Be not so terribly angry, O <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, and remember not twisted wrongness forever. Behold, please look, we are all your people.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.64.10">Your cities set apart for God have become a wilderness; Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.64.11">Our house set apart for God and beautiful, where our fathers praised you, has been burned by fire, and all our pleasant places have become ruins.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.64.12">Will you restrain yourself at these things, O <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>? Will you keep silent, and afflict us so terribly?</verse>

      <title type="sub">Judgment and Salvation</title>
      <verse osisID="Isa.65.1">"I was ready to be sought by those who did not ask for me; I was ready to be found by those who did not seek me. I said, 'Here I am, here I am,' to a nation that was not called by my name.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.65.2">I spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, following their own devices;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.65.3">a people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens and making offerings on bricks;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.65.4">who sit in tombs, and spend the night in secret places; who eat pig's flesh, and broth of tainted meat is in their vessels;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.65.5">who say, 'Keep to yourself, do not come near me, for I am too set apart for God for you.' These are a smoke in my nostrils, a fire that burns all the day.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.65.17">For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth, and the former things shall not be remembered or come into mind.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.65.18">But be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create; for behold, I create Jerusalem to be a joy, and her people to be a gladness.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.65.19">I will rejoice in Jerusalem and be glad in my people; no more shall be heard in it the sound of weeping and the cry of distress.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.65.20">No more shall there be in it an infant who lives but a few days, or an old man who does not fill out his days, for the young man shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner a hundred years old shall be accursed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.65.21">They shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.65.22">They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat; for like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.65.23">They shall not labor in vain or bear children for calamity, for they shall be the offspring of the blessed of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, and their descendants with them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.65.24">Before they call I will answer; while they are yet speaking I will hear.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.65.25">The wolf and the lamb shall graze together; the lion shall eat straw like the ox, and dust shall be the serpent's food. They shall not hurt or destroy in all my mountain set apart for God," says <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>.</verse>

      <title type="sub">Final Judgment and Future Glory</title>
      <verse osisID="Isa.66.1">Thus says <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>: "Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool; what is the house that you would build for me, and what is the place of my rest?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.66.2">All these things my hand has made, and so all these things came to be, declares <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>. But this is the one to whom I will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit and trembles at my word.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.66.3">"He who slaughters an ox is like one who kills a man; he who sacrifices a lamb, like one who breaks a dog's neck; he who presents a grain offering, like one who offers pig's blood; he who makes a memorial offering of frankincense, like one who blesses an idol. These have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.66.4">I also will choose harsh treatment for them and bring their fears upon them, because when I called, no one answered, when I spoke, they did not listen; but they did what was evil in my eyes and chose that in which I did not delight."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.66.5">Hear the word of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, you who tremble at his word: "Your brothers who hate you and cast you out for my name's sake have said, 'Let <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> be glorified, that we may see your joy'; but it is they who shall be put to shame.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.66.6">"The sound of an uproar from the city! A sound from the temple! The sound of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, rendering recompense to his enemies!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.66.7">"Before she was in labor she gave birth; before her pain came upon her she delivered a son.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.66.8">Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? Shall a nation be brought forth in one moment? For as soon as Zion was in labor she brought forth her children.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.66.9">Shall I bring to the point of birth and not cause to bring forth?" says <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>; "shall I, who cause to bring forth, shut the womb?" says your God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.66.10">"Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all you who love her; rejoice with her in joy, all you who mourn over her;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.66.11">that you may nurse and be satisfied from her consoling breast; that you may drink deeply with delight from her glorious abundance."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.66.12">For thus says <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>: "Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream; and you shall nurse, you shall be carried upon her hip, and bounced upon her knees.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.66.13">As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you; you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.66.14">You shall see, and your heart shall rejoice; your bones shall flourish like the grass; and the hand of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> shall be known to his servants, and he shall show his indignation against his enemies.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.66.15">For behold, <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> will come in fire, and his chariots like the whirlwind, to render his anger in fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.66.16">For by fire will <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> enter into judgment, and by his sword, with all flesh; and those slain by <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> shall be many.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.66.17">"Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following one in the midst, eating pig's flesh and the abomination and mice, shall come to an end together, declares <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.66.18">"For I know their works and their thoughts, and the time is coming to gather all nations and tongues. And they shall come and shall see my glory,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.66.19">and I will set a sign among them. And from them I will send survivors to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the coastlands far away, that have not heard my fame or seen my glory. And they shall declare my glory among the nations.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.66.20">And they shall bring all your brothers from all the nations as an offering to <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, on horses and in chariots and in litters and on mules and on dromedaries, to my mountain set apart for God, Jerusalem, says <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, just as the Israelites bring their grain offering in a clean vessel to the house of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.66.21">And some of them also I will take for priests and for Levites, says <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.66.22">"For as the new heavens and the new earth that I make shall remain before me, says <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, so shall your offspring and your name remain.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.66.23">From new moon to new moon, and from Sabbath to Sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me, declares <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Isa.66.24">"And they shall go out and look on the dead bodies of the men who have rebelled against me. For their worm shall not die, their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh."</verse>
