      <title type="main">Introduction</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.1">Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.2">just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.3">With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.4">so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Birth of John the Baptist Foretold</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.5">In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.6">Both of them were upright in the sight of God, observing all the Lord's commands and decrees blamelessly.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.7">But they were childless because Elizabeth was not able to conceive, and they were both very old.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.8">Once when Zechariah's division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.9">he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.10">And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.11">Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.12">When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.13">But the angel said to him: "Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.14">He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.15">for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.16">He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.17">And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the upright—to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.18">Zechariah asked the angel, "How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.19">The angel said to him, "I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.20">And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their appointed time."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.21">Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.22">When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.23">When his time of service was completed, he returned home.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.24">After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.25">"The Lord has done this for me," she said. "In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Birth of Jesus Foretold</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.26">In the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.27">to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.28">The angel went to her and said, "Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.29">Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.30">But the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary; you have found favor with God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.31">You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.32">He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.33">and he will reign over Jacob's descendants forever; his kingdom will never end."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.34">"How will this be," Mary asked the angel, "since I am a virgin?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.35">The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the set apart one to be born will be called the Son of God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.36">Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.37">For no word from God will ever fail."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.38">"I am the Lord's servant," Mary answered. "May your word to me be fulfilled." Then the angel left her.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Mary Visits Elizabeth</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.39">At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.40">where she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.41">When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.42">In a loud voice she exclaimed: "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.43">But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.44">As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.45">Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her!"</verse>
      <title type="sub">Mary's Song</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.46">And Mary said: "My soul glorifies the Lord</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.47">and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.48">for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant. From now on all generations will call me blessed,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.49">for the Mighty One has done great things for me— set apart is his name.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.50">His mercy extends to those who fear him, from generation to generation.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.51">He has performed mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.52">He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.53">He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.54">He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.55">to Abraham and his descendants forever, just as he promised our ancestors."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.56">Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Birth of John the Baptist</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.57">When it was time for Elizabeth to give birth, she had a son.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.58">Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.59">On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.60">but his mother spoke up and said, "No! He is to be called John."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.61">They said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who has that name."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.62">Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.63">He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone's astonishment he wrote, "His name is John."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.64">Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue set free, and he began to speak, praising God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.65">All the neighbors were filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judea people were talking about all these things.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.66">Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, "What then is this child going to be?" For the Lord's hand was with him.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Zechariah's Song</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.67">His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.68">"Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has come to his people and bought them back to freedom.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.69">He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.70">(as he said through his set apart prophets of long ago),</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.71">salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us—</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.72">to show mercy to our ancestors and to remember his set apart covenant,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.73">the oath he swore to our father Abraham:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.74">to rescue us from the hand of our enemies, and to enable us to serve him without fear</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.75">in the set apart way of right living and being in right standing with God all our days.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.76">And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.77">to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.78">because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.79">to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the path of peace."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.80">And the child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the wilderness until he appeared publicly to Israel.</verse>
      <chapter eID="Luke.1"/>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.2" sID="Luke.2"/>
      <title type="main">The Birth of Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.1">In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.2">(This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.)</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.3">And everyone went to their own town to register.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.4">So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.5">He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.6">While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.7">and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Shepherds and the Angels</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.8">And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.9">An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.10">But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.11">Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.12">This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.13">Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.14">"Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.15">When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.16">So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.17">When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.18">and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.19">But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.20">The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Presented in the Temple</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.21">On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise the child, he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he was conceived.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.22">When the time came for the purification rites required by the Law of Moses, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.23">(as it is written in the Law of the Lord, "Every firstborn male is to be set apart to the Lord"),</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.24">and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord: "a pair of doves or two young pigeons."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.25">Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was upright and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.26">It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Messiah.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.27">Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.28">Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.29">"Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you may now dismiss your servant in peace.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.30">For my eyes have seen your salvation,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.31">which you have prepared in the sight of all nations:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.32">a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of your people Israel."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.33">The child's father and mother marveled at what was said about him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.34">Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: "This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.35">so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.36">There was also a prophet, Anna, the daughter of Penuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.37">and then was a widow until she was eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.38">Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Boy Jesus at the Temple</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.39">When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.40">And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was on him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.41">Every year Jesus' parents went to Jerusalem for the Festival of the Passover.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.42">When he was twelve years old, they went up to the festival, according to the custom.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.43">After the festival was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.44">Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.45">When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.46">After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.47">Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.48">When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.49">"Why were you searching for me?" he asked. "Didn't you know I had to be in my Father's house?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.50">But they did not understand what he was saying to them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.51">Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.52">And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.</verse>

      <title type="main">John the Baptist Prepares the Way</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.1">In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar—when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene—</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.2">during the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.3">He went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of changing one's mind for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.4">As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: "A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.5">Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.6">And all people will see God's salvation.'"</verse>
      <title type="sub">John's Message and Ministry</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.7">John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.8">Produce fruit in keeping with changing your mind. And do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.9">The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.10">"What should we do then?" the crowd asked.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.11">John answered, "Anyone who has two shirts should share with the one who has none, and anyone who has food should do the same."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.12">Even tax collectors came to be baptized. "Teacher," they asked, "what should we do?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.13">"Don't collect any more than you are required to," he told them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.14">Then some soldiers asked him, "And what should we do?" He replied, "Don't extort money and don't accuse people falsely—be content with your pay."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.15">The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Messiah.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.16">John answered them all, "I baptize you with water. But one who is more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.17">His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.18">And with many other words John exhorted the people and proclaimed the good news to them.</verse>
      <title type="sub">John Imprisoned by Herod</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.19">But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of his marriage to Herodias, his brother's wife, and all the other evil things he had done,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.20">Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Baptism of Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.21">When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized too. And as he was praying, heaven was opened</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.22">and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Genealogy of Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.23">Now Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was the son, so it was thought, of Joseph, the son of Heli,</verse>

      <verse osisID="Luke.4.1">Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, left the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.2">where for forty days he was tempted by the devil. He ate nothing during those days, and at the end of them he was hungry.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.3">The devil said to him, "If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.4">Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live on bread alone.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.5">The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.6">And he said to him, "I will give you all their authority and splendor; it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.7">If you worship me, it will all be yours."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.8">Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Worship the Lord your God and serve him only.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.9">The devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. "If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down from here.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.10">For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you to guard you carefully;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.11">they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.12">Jesus answered, "It is said: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.13">When the devil had finished all this tempting, he left him until an opportune time.</verse>
      <title type="main">Jesus Begins His Ministry</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.14">Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.15">He was teaching in their synagogues, and everyone praised him.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Rejected at Nazareth</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.16">He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. He stood up to read,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.17">and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.18">"The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has oil poured on me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.19">to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.20">Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.21">He began by saying to them, "Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.22">All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. "Isn't this Joseph's son?" they asked.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.23">Jesus said to them, "Surely you will quote this proverb to me: 'Physician, heal yourself!' And you will tell me, 'Do here in your hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.24">"Truly I tell you," he continued, "no prophet is accepted in his hometown.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.25">I assure you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah's time, when the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.26">Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.27">And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed—only Naaman the Syrian."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.28">All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.29">They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him off the cliff.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.30">But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Drives Out an Impure Spirit</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.31">Then he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath he taught the people.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.32">They were amazed at his teaching, because his words had authority.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.33">In the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon, an impure spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.34">"Go away! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Set Apart One of God!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.35">"Be quiet!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!" Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.36">All the people were amazed and said to each other, "What words these are! With authority and power he gives orders to impure spirits and they come out!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.37">And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Heals Many</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.38">Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon. Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.39">So he bent over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began to wait on them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.40">At sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he healed them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.41">Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting, "You are the Son of God!" But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew he was the Messiah.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.42">At daybreak, Jesus went out to a solitary place. The people were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.43">But he said, "I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.44">And he kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea.</verse>

      <title type="main">Jesus Calls His First Disciples</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.1">One day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret, the people were crowding around him and listening to the word of God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.2">He saw at the water's edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.3">He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.4">When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, "Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.5">Simon answered, "Master, we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.6">When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.7">So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.8">When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus' knees and said, "Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.9">For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.10">and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon's partners. Then Jesus said to Simon, "Don't be afraid; from now on you will fish for people."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.11">So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Heals a Man with Leprosy</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.12">While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered with leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell with his face to the ground and begged him, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.13">Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" And immediately the leprosy left him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.14">Then Jesus ordered him, "Don't tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.15">Yet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.16">But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Forgives and Heals a Paralyzed Man</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.17">One day Jesus was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there. They had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with Jesus to heal the sick.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.18">Some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before Jesus.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.19">When they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.20">When Jesus saw their faith, he said, "Friend, your sins are forgiven."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.21">The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves, "Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.22">Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, "Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.23">Which is easier: to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.24">But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." So he said to the paralyzed man, "I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.25">Immediately he stood up in front of them, took what he had been lying on and went home praising God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.26">Everyone was amazed and gave praise to God. They were filled with awe and said, "We have seen remarkable things today."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Calls Levi and Eats with Sinners</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.27">After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. "Follow me," Jesus said to him,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.28">and Levi got up, left everything and followed him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.29">Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.30">But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.31">Jesus answered them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.32">I have not come to call those who are in right standing with God, but sinners to change their minds."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Questioned About Fasting</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.33">They said to him, "John's disciples often fast and pray, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours go on eating and drinking."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.34">Jesus answered, "Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while he is with them?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.35">But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; in those days they will fast."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.36">He told them this parable: "No one tears a piece out of a new garment to patch an old one. Otherwise, they will have torn the new garment, and the patch from the new will not match the old.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.37">And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.38">No, new wine must be poured into new wineskins.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.39">And no one after drinking old wine wants the new, for they say, 'The old is better.'"</verse>

      <verse osisID="Luke.6.1">One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain, rub them in their hands and eat the kernels.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.6.2">Some of the Pharisees asked, "Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.6.3">Jesus answered them, "Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.6.4">He entered the house of God, and taking the set apart bread, he ate what is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.6.5">Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.6.6">On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was shriveled.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.6.7">The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.6.8">But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand, "Get up and stand in front of everyone." So he got up and stood there.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.6.9">Then Jesus said to them, "I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.6.10">He looked around at them all, and then said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did so, and his hand was completely restored.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.6.11">But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Twelve Apostles</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.6.12">One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night praying to God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.6.13">When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles:</verse>

      <title type="sub">Blessings and Woes</title>

      <verse osisID="Luke.6.18">who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled by impure spirits were cured,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.6.19">and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him and healing them all.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.6.20">Looking at his disciples, he said: "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.6.21">Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.6.22">Blessed are you when people hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the Son of Man.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.6.23">Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in heaven. For that is how their ancestors treated the prophets.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.6.24">But terrible sorrow to you who are rich, for you have already received your comfort.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Luke.6.34">And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.6.35">But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.</verse>
