      <title type="main">Introduction</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.1">Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.2">just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.3">With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.4">so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Birth of John the Baptist Foretold</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.5">In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.6">Both of them were upright in the sight of God, observing all the Lord's commands and decrees blamelessly.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.7">But they were childless because Elizabeth was not able to conceive, and they were both very old.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.8">Once when Zechariah's division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.9">he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.10">And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.11">Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.12">When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.13">But the angel said to him: "Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.14">He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.15">for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.16">He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.17">And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the upright—to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.18">Zechariah asked the angel, "How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.19">The angel said to him, "I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.20">And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their appointed time."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.21">Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.22">When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.23">When his time of service was completed, he returned home.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.24">After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.25">"The Lord has done this for me," she said. "In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Birth of Jesus Foretold</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.26">In the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.27">to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.28">The angel went to her and said, "Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.29">Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.30">But the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary; you have found favor with God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.31">You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.32">He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.33">and he will reign over Jacob's descendants forever; his kingdom will never end."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.34">"How will this be," Mary asked the angel, "since I am a virgin?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.35">The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the set apart one to be born will be called the Son of God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.36">Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.37">For no word from God will ever fail."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.38">"I am the Lord's servant," Mary answered. "May your word to me be fulfilled." Then the angel left her.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Mary Visits Elizabeth</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.39">At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.40">where she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.41">When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.42">In a loud voice she exclaimed: "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.43">But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.44">As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.45">Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her!"</verse>
      <title type="sub">Mary's Song</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.46">And Mary said: "My soul glorifies the Lord</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.47">and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.48">for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant. From now on all generations will call me blessed,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.49">for the Mighty One has done great things for me— set apart is his name.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.50">His mercy extends to those who fear him, from generation to generation.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.51">He has performed mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.52">He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.53">He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.54">He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.55">to Abraham and his descendants forever, just as he promised our ancestors."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.56">Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Birth of John the Baptist</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.57">When it was time for Elizabeth to give birth, she had a son.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.58">Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.59">On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.60">but his mother spoke up and said, "No! He is to be called John."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.61">They said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who has that name."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.62">Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.63">He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone's astonishment he wrote, "His name is John."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.64">Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue set free, and he began to speak, praising God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.65">All the neighbors were filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judea people were talking about all these things.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.66">Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, "What then is this child going to be?" For the Lord's hand was with him.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Zechariah's Song</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.67">His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.68">"Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has come to his people and bought them back to freedom.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.69">He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.70">(as he said through his set apart prophets of long ago),</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.71">salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us—</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.72">to show mercy to our ancestors and to remember his set apart covenant,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.73">the oath he swore to our father Abraham:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.74">to rescue us from the hand of our enemies, and to enable us to serve him without fear</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.75">in the set apart way of right living and being in right standing with God all our days.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.76">And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.77">to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.78">because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.79">to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the path of peace."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.1.80">And the child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the wilderness until he appeared publicly to Israel.</verse>
      <chapter eID="Luke.1"/>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.2" sID="Luke.2"/>
      <title type="main">The Birth of Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.1">In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.2">(This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.)</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.3">And everyone went to their own town to register.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.4">So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.5">He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.6">While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.7">and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Shepherds and the Angels</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.8">And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.9">An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.10">But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.11">Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.12">This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.13">Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.14">"Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.15">When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.16">So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.17">When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.18">and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.19">But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.20">The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Presented in the Temple</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.21">On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise the child, he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he was conceived.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.22">When the time came for the purification rites required by the Law of Moses, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.23">(as it is written in the Law of the Lord, "Every firstborn male is to be set apart to the Lord"),</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.24">and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord: "a pair of doves or two young pigeons."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.25">Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was upright and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.26">It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Messiah.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.27">Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.28">Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.29">"Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you may now dismiss your servant in peace.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.30">For my eyes have seen your salvation,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.31">which you have prepared in the sight of all nations:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.32">a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of your people Israel."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.33">The child's father and mother marveled at what was said about him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.34">Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: "This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.35">so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.36">There was also a prophet, Anna, the daughter of Penuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.37">and then was a widow until she was eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.38">Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Boy Jesus at the Temple</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.39">When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.40">And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was on him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.41">Every year Jesus' parents went to Jerusalem for the Festival of the Passover.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.42">When he was twelve years old, they went up to the festival, according to the custom.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.43">After the festival was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.44">Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.45">When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.46">After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.47">Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.48">When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.49">"Why were you searching for me?" he asked. "Didn't you know I had to be in my Father's house?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.50">But they did not understand what he was saying to them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.51">Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.2.52">And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.</verse>

      <title type="main">John the Baptist Prepares the Way</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.1">In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar—when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene—</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.2">during the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.3">He went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of changing one's mind for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.4">As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: "A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.5">Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.6">And all people will see God's salvation.'"</verse>
      <title type="sub">John's Message and Ministry</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.7">John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.8">Produce fruit in keeping with changing your mind. And do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.9">The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.10">"What should we do then?" the crowd asked.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.11">John answered, "Anyone who has two shirts should share with the one who has none, and anyone who has food should do the same."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.12">Even tax collectors came to be baptized. "Teacher," they asked, "what should we do?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.13">"Don't collect any more than you are required to," he told them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.14">Then some soldiers asked him, "And what should we do?" He replied, "Don't extort money and don't accuse people falsely—be content with your pay."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.15">The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Messiah.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.16">John answered them all, "I baptize you with water. But one who is more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.17">His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.18">And with many other words John exhorted the people and proclaimed the good news to them.</verse>
      <title type="sub">John Imprisoned by Herod</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.19">But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of his marriage to Herodias, his brother's wife, and all the other evil things he had done,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.20">Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Baptism of Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.21">When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized too. And as he was praying, heaven was opened</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.22">and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Genealogy of Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.3.23">Now Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was the son, so it was thought, of Joseph, the son of Heli,</verse>

      <verse osisID="Luke.4.16">He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. He stood up to read,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.17">and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written:</verse>

      <verse osisID="Luke.4.33">In the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon, an impure spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.34">"Go away! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Set Apart One of God!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.35">"Be quiet!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!" Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Luke.4.39">So he bent over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began to wait on them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.40">At sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he healed them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.41">Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting, "You are the Son of God!" But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew he was the Messiah.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.42">At daybreak, Jesus went out to a solitary place. The people were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.4.43">But he said, "I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent."</verse>

      <verse osisID="Luke.5.3">He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.4">When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, "Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.5">Simon answered, "Master, we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.6">When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.7">So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.8">When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus' knees and said, "Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.9">For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.10">and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon's partners. Then Jesus said to Simon, "Don't be afraid; from now on you will fish for people."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.11">So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Heals a Man with Leprosy</title>

      <verse osisID="Luke.5.13">Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" And immediately the leprosy left him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.14">Then Jesus ordered him, "Don't tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.15">Yet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses.</verse>

      <title type="sub">Jesus Forgives and Heals a Paralyzed Man</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.17">One day Jesus was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there. They had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with Jesus to heal the sick.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Luke.5.19">When they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.20">When Jesus saw their faith, he said, "Friend, your sins are forgiven."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.21">The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves, "Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.22">Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, "Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.23">Which is easier: to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.5.24">But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." So he said to the paralyzed man, "I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home."</verse>

      <verse osisID="Luke.5.30">But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"</verse>

      <verse osisID="Luke.7.16">They were all filled with awe and praised God. "A great prophet has appeared among us," they said. "God has come to help his people."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.17">This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus and John the Baptist</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.18">John's disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.19">he sent them to the Lord to ask, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.20">When the men came to Jesus, they said, "John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, 'Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.21">At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.22">So he replied to the messengers, "Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.23">Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.24">After John's messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.25">If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.26">But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.27">This is the one about whom it is written: 'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.28">I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.29">(All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus' words, acknowledged that God's way was right, because they had been baptized by John.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.30">But the Pharisees and the experts in the law rejected God's purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.)</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.31">Jesus went on to say, "To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.32">They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other: 'We played the pipe for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not cry.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.33">For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.34">The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.35">But wisdom is proved right by all her children."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Anointed by a Sinful Woman</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.36">When one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, he went to the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.37">A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house, so she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.38">As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.39">When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is—that she is a sinner."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.40">Jesus answered him, "Simon, I have something to tell you." "Tell me, teacher," he said.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.41">"Two people owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.</verse>
      <note type="translation">A denarius was the usual daily wage of a day laborer</note>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.42">Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.43">Simon replied, "I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven." "You have judged correctly," Jesus said.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.44">Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.45">You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.46">You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.47">Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven—as her great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.48">Then Jesus said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.49">The other guests began to say among themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.7.50">Jesus said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace."</verse>

      <title type="main">The Parable of the Sower</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.1">After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.2">and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.3">Joanna the wife of Chuza, the manager of Herod's household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.4">While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.5">"A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds ate it up.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.6">Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.7">Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.8">Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown." When he said this, he called out, "Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.9">His disciples asked him what this parable meant.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.10">He said, "The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, 'though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.11">This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.12">Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.13">Those on the rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.14">The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life's worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.15">But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop.</verse>
      <title type="sub">A Lamp on a Stand</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.16">No one lights a lamp and hides it in a clay jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, they put it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.17">For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.18">Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they think they have will be taken from them."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus' Mother and Brothers</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.19">Now Jesus' mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.20">Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.21">He replied, "My mother and brothers are those who hear God's word and put it into practice."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Calms the Storm</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.22">One day Jesus said to his disciples, "Let us go over to the other side of the lake." So they got into a boat and set out.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.23">As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.24">The disciples went and woke him, saying, "Master, Master, we're going to drown!" He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.25">"Where is your faith?" he asked his disciples. In fear and amazement they asked one another, "Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Restores a Demon-Possessed Man</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.26">They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from Galilee.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.27">When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.28">When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don't torture me!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.29">For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.30">Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" "Legion," he replied, because many demons had gone into him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.31">And they begged Jesus repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.32">A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs, and he gave them permission.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.33">When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.34">When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.35">and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.36">Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.37">Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.38">The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.39">"Return home and tell how much God has done for you." So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Raises a Dead Girl and Heals a Sick Woman</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.40">Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.41">Then a man named Jairus, a synagogue leader, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come to his house</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.42">because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.43">And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no one could heal her.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.44">She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.45">"Who touched me?" Jesus asked. When they all denied it, Peter said, "Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.46">But Jesus said, "Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.47">Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.48">Then he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.49">While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. "Your daughter is dead," he said. "Don't bother the teacher anymore."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.50">Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, "Don't be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.51">When he arrived at the house, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John and James, and the child's father and mother.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.52">Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. "Stop wailing," Jesus said. "She is not dead but asleep."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.53">They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.54">But he took her by the hand and said, "My child, get up!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.55">Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.8.56">Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.</verse>

      <title type="main">Jesus Sends Out the Twelve</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.1">When Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.2">and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.3">He told them: "Take nothing for the journey—no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra shirt.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.4">Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that town.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.5">If people do not welcome you, leave their town and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.6">So they set out and went from village to village, proclaiming the good news and healing people everywhere.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Herod's Confusion</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.7">Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on. And he was perplexed because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.8">others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.9">But Herod said, "I beheaded John. Who, then, is this I hear such things about?" And he tried to see him.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.10">When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.11">but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.12">Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and said, "Send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging, because we are in a remote place here."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.13">He replied, "You give them something to eat." They answered, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish—unless we go and buy food for all this crowd."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.14">(About five thousand men were there.) But he said to his disciples, "Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.15">The disciples did so, and everyone sat down.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.16">Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to distribute to the people.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.17">They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Peter Declares That Jesus Is the Messiah</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.18">Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, "Who do the crowds say I am?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.19">They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.20">"But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?" Peter answered, "God's Messiah."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.21">Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.22">And he said, "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.23">Then he said to them all: "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.24">For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will save it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.25">What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit their very self?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.26">Whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.27">Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Transfiguration</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.28">About eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.29">As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.30">Two men, Moses and Elijah, appeared in glorious splendor, talking with Jesus.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.31">They spoke about his departure, which he was about to bring to fulfillment at Jerusalem.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.32">Peter and his companions were very sleepy, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.33">As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, "Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah." (He did not know what he was saying.)</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.34">While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and covered them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.35">A voice came from the cloud, saying, "This is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.36">When the voice had spoken, they found that Jesus was alone. The disciples kept this to themselves and did not tell anyone at that time what they had seen.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Heals a Demon-Possessed Boy</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.37">The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.38">A man in the crowd called out, "Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.39">A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.40">I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they could not."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.41">"You unbelieving and perverse generation," Jesus replied, "how long shall I stay with you and put up with you? Bring your son here."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.42">Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the impure spirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.43">And they were all amazed at the greatness of God. While everyone was marveling at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.44">"Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you: The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.45">But they did not understand what this meant. It was hidden from them, so that they did not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask him about it.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Arguments About Who Would Be Greatest</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.46">An argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.47">Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a little child and had him stand beside him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.48">Then he said to them, "Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For it is the one who is least among you all who is the greatest."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.49">"Master," said John, "we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him, because he is not one of us."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.50">"Do not stop him," Jesus said, "for whoever is not against you is for you."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Samaritan Opposition</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.51">As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.52">And he sent messengers on ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.53">but the people there did not welcome him, because he was heading for Jerusalem.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.54">When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, "Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.55">But Jesus turned and rebuked them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.56">Then he and his disciples went to another village.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Cost of Following Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.57">As they were walking along the road, a man said to him, "I will follow you wherever you go."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.58">Jesus replied, "Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.59">He said to another man, "Follow me." But he replied, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.60">Jesus said to him, "Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.61">Still another said, "I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say goodbye to my family."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.9.62">Jesus replied, "No one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God."</verse>

      <verse osisID="Luke.10.1">After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.2">He told them, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.3">Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.4">Do not take a purse or bag or sandals; and do not greet anyone on the road.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.5">When you enter a house, first say, 'Peace to this house.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.6">If someone who promotes peace is there, your peace will rest on them; if not, it will return to you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.7">Stay there, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move around from house to house.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.8">When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is offered to you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.9">Heal the sick who are there and tell them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.10">But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.11">'Even the dust of your town we wipe from our feet as a warning to you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God has come near.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.12">I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.13">Terrible sorrow to you, Chorazin! Terrible sorrow to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have changed their minds long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.14">But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.15">And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.16">Whoever listens to you listens to me; whoever rejects you rejects me; but whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.17">The seventy-two returned with joy and said, "Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.18">He replied, "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.19">I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.20">However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.21">At that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.22">All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.23">Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, "Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.24">For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Parable of the Good Samaritan</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.25">On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. "Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.26">"What is written in the Law?" he replied. "How do you read it?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.27">He answered, "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; and, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.28">"You have answered correctly," Jesus replied. "Do this and you will live."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.29">But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.30">In reply Jesus said: "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.31">A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.32">So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.33">But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.34">He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.35">The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. 'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.36">Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.37">The expert in the law replied, "The one who had mercy on him." Jesus told him, "Go and do likewise."</verse>
      <title type="sub">At the Home of Martha and Mary</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.38">As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.39">She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet listening to what he said.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.40">But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, "Lord, don't you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.41">"Martha, Martha," the Lord answered, "you are worried and upset about many things,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.10.42">but few things are needed—or indeed only one. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her."</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Luke.11" sID="Luke.11"/>
      <title type="main">Jesus' Teaching on Prayer</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.1">One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.2">He said to them, "When you pray, say: 'Father, set apart your name as special. May your kingdom come.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.3">Give us each day our daily bread.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.4">Forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who sins against us. And lead us not into temptation.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.5">Then Jesus said to them, "Suppose you have a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.6">a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have no food to offer him.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.7">And suppose the one inside answers, 'Don't bother me. The door is already locked, and my children and I are in bed. I can't get up and give you anything.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.8">I tell you, even though he will not get up and give you the bread because of friendship, yet because of your shameless audacity he will surely get up and give you as much as you need.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.9">So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.10">For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.11">Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.12">Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.13">If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!"</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus and Beelzebul</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.14">Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. When the demon left, the man who had been mute spoke, and the crowd was amazed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.15">But some of them said, "By Beelzebul, the prince of demons, he is driving out demons."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.16">Others tested him by asking for a sign from heaven.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.17">Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them: "Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.18">If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? I say this because you claim that I drive out demons by Beelzebul.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.19">Now if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your followers drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.20">But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.21">When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are safe.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.22">But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armor in which the man trusted and divides up his plunder.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.23">Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.24">When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, 'I will return to the house I left.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.25">When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.26">Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.27">As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out, "Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.28">He replied, "Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Sign of Jonah</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.29">As the crowds increased, Jesus said, "This is a wicked generation. It asks for a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.30">For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.31">The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom; and now something greater than Solomon is here.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.32">The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they changed their minds at the preaching of Jonah; and now something greater than Jonah is here.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Lamp of the Body</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.33">No one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden, or under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, so that those who come in may see the light.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.34">Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are healthy, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are unhealthy, your body also is full of darkness.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.35">See to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.36">Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, and no part of it dark, it will be just as full of light as when a lamp shines its light on you."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Woes on the Pharisees and the Experts in the Law</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.37">When Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to eat with him; so he went in and reclined at the table.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.38">But the Pharisee was surprised when he noticed that Jesus did not first wash before the meal.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.39">Then the Lord said to him, "Now then, you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.40">You foolish people! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.41">But now as for what is inside you—be generous to the poor, and everything will be clean for you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.42">Terrible sorrow to you Pharisees, because you give God a tenth of your mint, rue and all other kinds of garden herbs, but you neglect justice and the love of God. You should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.43">Terrible sorrow to you Pharisees, because you love the most important seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the marketplaces.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.44">Terrible sorrow to you, because you are like unmarked graves, which people walk over without knowing it."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.45">One of the experts in the law answered him, "Teacher, when you say these things, you insult us also."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.46">Jesus replied, "And you experts in the law, terrible sorrow to you, because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry, and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.47">Terrible sorrow to you, because you build tombs for the prophets, and it was your ancestors who killed them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.48">So you testify that you approve of what your ancestors did; they killed the prophets, and you build their tombs.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.49">Because of this, God in his wisdom said, 'I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and others they will persecute.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.50">Therefore this generation will be held responsible for the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.51">from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, this generation will be held responsible for it all.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.52">Terrible sorrow to you experts in the law, because you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.53">When Jesus went outside, the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to oppose him fiercely and to besiege him with questions,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.11.54">waiting to catch him in something he might say.</verse>
      <chapter eID="Luke.11"/>
      <chapter osisID="Luke.12" sID="Luke.12"/>
      <title type="main">Warnings and Encouragements</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.1">Meanwhile, when a crowd of many thousands had gathered, so that they were trampling on one another, Jesus began to speak first to his disciples, saying: "Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.2">There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.3">What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.4">I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.5">But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear him who, after your body has been killed, has authority to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.6">Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.7">Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.8">I tell you, whoever publicly acknowledges me before others, the Son of Man will also acknowledge before the angels of God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.9">But whoever disowns me before others will be disowned before the angels of God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.10">And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks insults against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.11">When you are brought before synagogues, rulers and authorities, do not worry about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.12">for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what you should say."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Parable of the Rich Fool</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.13">Someone in the crowd said to him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.14">Jesus replied, "Man, who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.15">Then he said to them, "Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.16">And he told them this parable: "The ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.17">He thought to himself, 'What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.18">Then he said, 'This is what I'll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus grain.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.19">And I'll say to myself, "You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry."'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.20">But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.21">This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Do Not Worry</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.22">Then Jesus said to his disciples: "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.23">For life is more than food, and the body more than clothes.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.24">Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.25">Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to your life?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.26">Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.27">Consider how the wild flowers grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.28">If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you—you of little faith!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.29">And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink; do not worry about it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.30">For the pagan world runs after all such things, and your Father knows that you need them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.31">But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.32">Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.33">Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a treasure in heaven that will never fail, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.34">For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Watchfulness</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.35">Be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.36">like servants waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.37">It will be good for those servants whose master finds them watching when he comes. Truly I tell you, he will dress himself to serve, will have them recline at the table and will come and wait on them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.38">It will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready, even if he comes in the middle of the night or toward daybreak.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.39">But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.40">You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.41">Peter asked, "Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everyone?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.42">The Lord answered, "Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.43">It will be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.44">Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.45">But suppose the servant says to himself, 'My master is taking a long time in coming,' and he then begins to beat the other servants, both men and women, and to eat and drink and get drunk.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.46">The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.47">The servant who knows the master's will and does not get ready or does not do what the master wants will be beaten with many blows.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.48">But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Not Peace but Division</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.49">I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.50">But I have a baptism to undergo, and what constraint I am under until it is completed!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.51">Do you think I came to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.52">From now on there will be five in one family divided against each other, three against two and two against three.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.53">They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Interpreting the Times</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.54">He said to the crowd: "When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, 'It's going to rain,' and it does.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.55">And when the south wind blows, you say, 'It's going to be hot,' and it is.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.56">Hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky. How is it that you don't know how to interpret this present time?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.57">Why don't you judge for yourselves what is right?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.58">As you are going with your adversary to the magistrate, try hard to be reconciled on the way, or your adversary may drag you off to the judge, and the judge turn you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.12.59">I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny."</verse>

      <title type="main">Change Your Mind or Perish</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.1">Now there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.2">Jesus answered, "Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.3">I tell you, no! But unless you change your minds, you too will all perish.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.4">Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them—do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.5">I tell you, no! But unless you change your minds, you too will all perish."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.6">Then he told this parable: "A man had a fig tree growing in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it but did not find any.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.7">So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, 'For three years now I've been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven't found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.8">'Sir,' the man replied, 'leave it alone for one more year, and I'll dig around it and fertilize it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.9">If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down.'"</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Heals a Crippled Woman on the Sabbath</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.10">On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.11">and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten up at all.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.12">When Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, "Woman, you are set free from your infirmity."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.13">Then he put his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and praised God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.14">Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue leader said to the people, "There are six days for work. So come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.15">The Lord answered, "You hypocrites! Doesn't each of you on the Sabbath untie your ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.16">Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.17">When he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, but the people were delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.18">Then Jesus asked, "What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I compare it to?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.19">It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds perched in its branches."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.20">Again he asked, "What shall I compare the kingdom of God to?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.21">It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Narrow Door</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.22">Then Jesus went through the towns and villages, teaching as he made his way to Jerusalem.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.23">Someone asked him, "Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?" He said to them,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.24">"Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.25">Once the owner of the house gets up and closes the door, you will stand outside knocking and pleading, 'Sir, open the door for us.' But he will answer, 'I don't know you or where you come from.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.26">Then you will say, 'We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.27">But he will reply, 'I don't know you or where you come from. Away from me, all you evildoers!'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.28">There will be weeping there, and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown out.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.29">People will come from east and west and north and south, and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.30">Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last."</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus' Sorrow for Jerusalem</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.31">At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said to him, "Leave this place and go somewhere else. Herod wants to kill you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.32">He replied, "Go tell that fox, 'I will keep on driving out demons and healing people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.33">In any case, I must press on today and tomorrow and the next day—for surely no prophet can die outside Jerusalem!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.34">Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.13.35">Look, your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'"</verse>

      <title type="main">Jesus at a Pharisee's House</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.1">One Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent Pharisee, he was being carefully watched.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.2">There in front of him was a man suffering from abnormal swelling of his body.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.3">Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.4">But they remained silent. So taking hold of the man, he healed him and sent him on his way.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.5">Then he asked them, "If one of you has a child or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull it out?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.6">And they had nothing to say.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.7">When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, he told them this parable:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.8">"When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.9">If so, the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, 'Give this person your seat.' Then, humiliated, you will have to take the least important place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.10">But when you are invited, take the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he will say to you, 'Friend, move up to a better place.' Then you will be honored in the presence of all the other guests.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.11">For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.12">Then Jesus said to his host, "When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers or sisters, your relatives, or your rich neighbors; if you do, they may invite you back and so you will be repaid.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.13">But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.14">and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of those who are in right standing with God."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Parable of the Great Banquet</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.15">When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to Jesus, "Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.16">Jesus replied: "A certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.17">At the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited, 'Come, for everything is now ready.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.18">But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said, 'I have just bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse me.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.19">Another said, 'I have just bought five yoke of oxen, and I'm on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.20">Still another said, 'I just got married, so I can't come.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.21">The servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.22">'Sir,' the servant said, 'what you ordered has been done, but there is still room.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.23">Then the master told his servant, 'Go out to the roads and country lanes and compel them to come in, so that my house will be full.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.24">I tell you, not one of those who were invited will get a taste of my banquet.'"</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Cost of Being a Disciple</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.25">Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and turning to them he said:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.26">"If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters—yes, even their own life—such a person cannot be my disciple.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.27">And whoever does not carry their cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.28">Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won't you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.29">For if you lay the foundation and are not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule you,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.30">saying, 'This person began to build and wasn't able to finish.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.31">Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Won't he first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.32">If he is not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.33">In the same way, those of you who do not give up everything you have cannot be my disciples.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.34">Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.14.35">It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile; it is thrown out. Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear."</verse>

      <chapter osisID="Luke.15" sID="Luke.15"/>
      <title type="main">The Parable of the Lost Sheep</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.1">Now the tax collectors and sinners were all gathering around to hear Jesus.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.2">But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, "This man welcomes sinners and eats with them."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.3">Then Jesus told them this parable:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.4">"Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn't he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.5">And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.6">and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, 'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.7">I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who changes his mind than over ninety-nine people in right standing with God who do not need to change their minds.</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Parable of the Lost Coin</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.8">Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one. Doesn't she light a lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.9">And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, 'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.10">In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who changes his mind."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Parable of the Lost Son</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.11">Jesus continued: "There was a man who had two sons.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.12">The younger one said to his father, 'Father, give me my share of the estate.' So he divided his property between them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.13">Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.14">After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.15">So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.16">He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.17">When he came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have food to spare, and here I am starving to death!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.18">I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.19">I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.20">So he got up and went to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.21">The son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.22">But the father said to his servants, 'Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.23">Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let's have a feast and celebrate.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.24">For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.' So they began to celebrate.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.25">Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.26">So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.27">'Your brother has come,' he replied, 'and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.28">The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.29">But he answered his father, 'Look! All these years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.30">But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.31">'My son,' the father said, 'you are always with me, and everything I have is yours.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.15.32">But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.'"</verse>

      <title type="main">Jesus Has Risen</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.1">On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.2">They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.3">but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.4">While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.5">In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, "Why do you look for the living among the dead?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.6">He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.7">'The Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.8">Then they remembered his words.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.9">When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.10">It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.11">But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.12">Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.</verse>
      <title type="sub">On the Road to Emmaus</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.13">Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.14">They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.15">As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.16">but they were kept from recognizing him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.17">He asked them, "What are you discussing together as you walk along?" They stood still, their faces downcast.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.18">One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, "Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.19">"What things?" he asked. "About Jesus of Nazareth," they replied. "He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.20">The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.21">but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to buy back Israel's freedom. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.22">In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.23">but didn't find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.24">Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see Jesus."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.25">He said to them, "How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.26">Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.27">And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.28">As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus continued on as if he were going farther.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.29">But they urged him strongly, "Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over." So he went in to stay with them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.30">When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.31">Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.32">They asked each other, "Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.33">They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.34">and saying, "It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.35">Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread.</verse>
      <title type="sub">Jesus Appears to the Disciples</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.36">While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, "Peace be with you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.37">They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.38">He said to them, "Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.39">Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.40">When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.41">And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.42">They gave him a piece of broiled fish,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.43">and he took it and ate it in their presence.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.44">He said to them, "This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.45">Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.46">He told them, "This is what is written: The Messiah will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.47">and changing of mind for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.48">You are witnesses of these things.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.49">I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high."</verse>
      <title type="sub">The Ascension of Jesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.50">When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.51">While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.52">Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Luke.24.53">And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God.</verse>
