      <chapter osisID="Heb.1">
        <title type="chapter">Chapter 1</title>
        <title type="main">God's Final Message Through His Son</title>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.1">Long ago God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets in many different ways and at many different times.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.2">But in these last days, he has spoken to us through his Son. God appointed him to inherit everything, and through him God created the universe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.3">The Son radiates God's glory and is the exact representation of his being. He sustains everything by his powerful word. After he had cleansed people from their sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.4">He has become so much better than the angels because he has inherited a name far superior to theirs.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">The Son Superior to Angels</title>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.5">To which of the angels did God ever say, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father"? Or again, "I will be his Father, and he will be my Son"?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.6">And again, when God brings his firstborn into the world, he says, "Let all God's angels worship him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.7">About the angels he says, "He makes his angels spirits, and his servants flames of fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.8">But about the Son he says, "Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.9">You have loved doing what's right<note type="translation">Greek: righteousness</note> and hated lawlessness; therefore God, your God, has poured oil on you<note type="translation">Greek: anointed you</note> with the oil of joy more than on your companions."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.10">He also says, "In the beginning, Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.11">They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.12">You will roll them up like a robe; like a garment they will be changed. But you remain the same, and your years will never end."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.13">To which of the angels did God ever say, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet"?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.14">Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.2">
        <title type="chapter">Chapter 2</title>
        <title type="main">Warning to Pay Attention</title>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.1">Therefore, we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, so we don't drift away from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.2">For if the message spoken through angels was legally binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.3">how will we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? This salvation was first announced by the Lord, and it was confirmed to us by those who heard him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.4">God also testified to it by signs, wonders, and various miracles, and by gifts of the Spirit set apart for God<note type="translation">Greek: Holy Spirit</note> distributed according to his will.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">Jesus Made Like His Brothers</title>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.5">God did not subject the future world we are talking about to angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.6">But someone has testified somewhere: "What are mere mortals that you are mindful of them, or human beings that you care for them?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.7">You made them a little lower than the angels; you crowned them with glory and honor</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.8">and put everything under their feet." In putting everything under them, God left nothing that is not subject to them. Yet at present we do not see everything subject to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.9">But we do see Jesus, who was made lower than the angels for a little while, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by God's grace he might taste death for everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.10">In bringing many sons and daughters to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through what he suffered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.11">Both the one who makes people set apart for God<note type="translation">Greek: sanctifies</note> and those who are being made set apart for God<note type="translation">Greek: being sanctified</note> are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.12">He says, "I will declare your name to my brothers and sisters; in the assembly I will sing your praises."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.13">And again, "I will put my trust in him." And again he says, "Here am I, and the children God has given me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.14">Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death—that is, the devil—</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.15">and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.16">For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham's descendants.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.17">For this reason he had to be made like them, fully human in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make things right<note type="translation">Greek: make atonement</note> for the sins of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.18">Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.</verse>
