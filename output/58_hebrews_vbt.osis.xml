        <title type="chapter">Chapter 1</title>
        <title type="main">God's Final Message Through His Son</title>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.1">Long ago God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets in many different ways and at many different times.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.2">But in these last days, he has spoken to us through his Son. God appointed him to inherit everything, and through him God created the universe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.3">The Son radiates God's glory and is the exact representation of his being. He sustains everything by his powerful word. After he had cleansed people from their sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.4">He has become so much better than the angels because he has inherited a name far superior to theirs.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">The Son Superior to Angels</title>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.5">To which of the angels did God ever say, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father"? Or again, "I will be his Father, and he will be my Son"?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.6">And again, when God brings his firstborn into the world, he says, "Let all God's angels worship him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.7">About the angels he says, "He makes his angels spirits, and his servants flames of fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.8">But about the Son he says, "Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.9">You have loved doing what's right<note type="translation">Greek: righteousness</note> and hated lawlessness; therefore God, your God, has poured oil on you<note type="translation">Greek: anointed you</note> with the oil of joy more than on your companions."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.10">He also says, "In the beginning, Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.11">They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.12">You will roll them up like a robe; like a garment they will be changed. But you remain the same, and your years will never end."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.13">To which of the angels did God ever say, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet"?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.14">Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.2">
        <title type="chapter">Chapter 2</title>
        <title type="main">Warning to Pay Attention</title>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.1">Therefore, we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, so we don't drift away from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.2">For if the message spoken through angels was legally binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.3">how will we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? This salvation was first announced by the Lord, and it was confirmed to us by those who heard him.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.4">God also testified to it by signs, wonders, and various miracles, and by gifts of the Spirit set apart for God<note type="translation">Greek: Holy Spirit</note> distributed according to his will.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">Jesus Made Like His Brothers</title>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.5">God did not subject the future world we are talking about to angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.6">But someone has testified somewhere: "What are mere mortals that you are mindful of them, or human beings that you care for them?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.7">You made them a little lower than the angels; you crowned them with glory and honor</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.8">and put everything under their feet." In putting everything under them, God left nothing that is not subject to them. Yet at present we do not see everything subject to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.9">But we do see Jesus, who was made lower than the angels for a little while, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by God's grace he might taste death for everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.10">In bringing many sons and daughters to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through what he suffered.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.11">Both the one who makes people set apart for God<note type="translation">Greek: sanctifies</note> and those who are being made set apart for God<note type="translation">Greek: being sanctified</note> are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.12">He says, "I will declare your name to my brothers and sisters; in the assembly I will sing your praises."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.13">And again, "I will put my trust in him." And again he says, "Here am I, and the children God has given me."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.14">Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death—that is, the devil—</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.15">and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.16">For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham's descendants.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.17">For this reason he had to be made like them, fully human in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make things right<note type="translation">Greek: make atonement</note> for the sins of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.2.18">Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.3">
        <title type="chapter">Chapter 3</title>
        <title type="main">Jesus Greater Than Moses</title>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.1">Therefore, set apart for God<note type="translation">Greek: holy</note> brothers and sisters, who share in the heavenly calling, focus your thoughts on Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we acknowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.2">He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all God's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.3">Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.4">For every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.5">Moses was faithful as a servant in all God's house, bearing witness to what would be spoken by God in the future.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.6">But Christ is faithful as the Son over God's house. And we are his house, if indeed we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope in which we boast.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">Warning Against Unbelief</title>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.7">So, as the Spirit set apart for God<note type="translation">Greek: Holy Spirit</note> says: "Today, if you hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.8">do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion, during the time of testing in the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.9">where your ancestors tested and tried me, though for forty years they saw what I did.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.10">That is why I was angry with that generation; I said, 'Their hearts are always going astray, and they have not known my ways.'</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.11">So I declared on oath in my anger, 'They shall never enter my rest.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.12">See to it, brothers and sisters, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.13">But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called "Today," so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.14">We have come to share in Christ if indeed we hold our original conviction firmly to the very end.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.15">As has just been said: "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.16">Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.17">And with whom was God angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies perished in the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.18">And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who disobeyed?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.3.19">So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their unbelief.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.4">
        <title type="chapter">Chapter 4</title>
        <title type="main">A Sabbath Rest for God's People</title>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.1">Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.2">For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because they did not share the faith of those who obeyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.3">Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said, "So I declared on oath in my anger, 'They shall never enter my rest.'" And yet his works have been finished since the creation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.4">For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words: "On the seventh day God rested from all his works."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.5">And again in the passage above he says, "They shall never enter my rest."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.6">Therefore since it still remains for some to enter that rest, and since those who formerly had the good news proclaimed to them did not go in because of their disobedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.7">God again set a certain day, calling it "Today." This he did when a long time later he spoke through David, as in the passage already quoted: "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.8">For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.9">There remains, then, a Sabbath rest for the people of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.10">for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from their works, just as God did from his.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.11">Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will perish by following their example of disobedience.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">The Word of God is Living and Active</title>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.12">For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.13">Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">Jesus the Great High Priest</title>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.14">Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.15">For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.4.16">Let us then approach God's throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.5">
        <title type="chapter">Chapter 5</title>
        <title type="main">Qualifications of a High Priest</title>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.1">Every high priest is selected from among the people and is appointed to represent the people in matters related to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.2">He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray, since he himself is subject to weakness.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.3">This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.4">And no one takes this honor on himself, but he receives it when called by God, just as Aaron was.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">Christ as High Priest</title>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.5">In the same way, Christ did not take on himself the glory of becoming a high priest. But God said to him, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.6">And he says in another place, "You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.7">During the days of Jesus' life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with fervent cries and tears to the one who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.8">Son though he was, he learned obedience from what he suffered</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.9">and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.10">and was designated by God to be high priest in the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">Warning Against Falling Away</title>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.11">We have much to say about this, but it is hard to make it clear to you because you no longer try to understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.12">In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God's word all over again. You need milk, not solid food!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.13">Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about being in right standing with God<note type="translation">Greek: righteousness</note>.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.5.14">But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.6">
        <title type="chapter">Chapter 6</title>
        <title type="main">Warning Against Falling Away</title>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.1">Therefore let us move beyond the elementary teachings about Christ and be taken forward to maturity, not laying again the foundation of changing our minds<note type="translation">Greek: repentance</note> from acts that lead to death, and of faith in God,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.2">instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.3">And God permitting, we will do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.4">It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Spirit set apart for God<note type="translation">Greek: Holy Spirit</note>,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.5">who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.6">and who have fallen away, to be brought back to changing their minds<note type="translation">Greek: repentance</note>. To their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.7">Land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is farmed receives the blessing of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.8">But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in danger of being cursed. In the end it will be burned.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">Hope and Assurance</title>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.9">Even though we speak like this, dear friends, we are convinced of better things in your case—the things that have to do with salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.10">God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.11">We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end, so that what you hope for may be fully realized.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.12">We do not want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">God's Promise Is Sure</title>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.13">When God made his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater for him to swear by, he swore by himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.14">saying, "I will surely bless you and give you many descendants."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.15">And so after waiting patiently, Abraham received what was promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.16">People swear by someone greater than themselves, and the oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.17">Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised, he confirmed it with an oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.18">God did this so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope set before us may be greatly encouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.19">We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.6.20">where our forerunner, Jesus, has entered on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID="Heb.7">
        <title type="chapter">Chapter 7</title>
        <title type="main">Melchizedek the Priest</title>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.1">This Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of God Most High. He met Abraham returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.2">and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything. First, the name Melchizedek means "king of what's right<note type="translation">Greek: righteousness</note>"; then also, "king of Salem" means "king of peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.3">Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, resembling the Son of God, he remains a priest forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.4">Just think how great he was: Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the plunder!</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.5">Now the law requires the descendants of Levi who become priests to collect a tenth from the people—that is, from their fellow Israelites—even though they also are descended from Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.6">This man, however, did not trace his descent from Levi, yet he collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.7">And without doubt the lesser is blessed by the greater.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.8">In the one case, the tenth is collected by people who die; but in the other case, by him who is declared to be living.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.9">One might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through Abraham,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.10">because when Melchizedek met Abraham, Levi was still in the body of his ancestor.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">Jesus Like Melchizedek</title>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.11">If perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood—and indeed the law was given while this priesthood was in effect—why was there still need for another priest to come, one in the order of Melchizedek, not in the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.12">For when the priesthood is changed, the law must be changed also.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.13">He of whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.14">For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah, and in regard to that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.15">And what we have said is even more clear if another priest like Melchizedek appears,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.16">one who has become a priest not on the basis of a regulation as to his ancestry but on the basis of the power of an indestructible life.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.17">For it is declared: "You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.18">The former regulation is set aside because it was weak and useless</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.19">(for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which we draw near to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.20">And it was not without an oath! Others became priests without any oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.21">but he became a priest with an oath when God said to him: "The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: 'You are a priest forever.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.22">Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantor of a better covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.23">Now there have been many of those priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office;</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.24">but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.25">Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.26">Such a high priest truly meets our need—one who is set apart for God<note type="translation">Greek: holy</note>, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.27">Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.7.28">For the law appoints as high priests men in all their weakness; but the oath, which came after the law, appointed the Son, who has been made perfect forever.</verse>
