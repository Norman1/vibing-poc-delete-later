        <verse osisID="Heb.1.1">Long ago God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets in many different ways and at many different times.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.2">But in these last days, he has spoken to us through his Son. God appointed him to inherit everything, and through him God created the universe.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.3">The Son radiates God's glory and is the exact representation of his being. He sustains everything by his powerful word. After he had cleansed people from their sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.4">He has become so much better than the angels because he has inherited a name far superior to theirs.</verse>
        
        <title type="sub">The Son Superior to Angels</title>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.5">To which of the angels did God ever say, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father"? Or again, "I will be his Father, and he will be my Son"?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.6">And again, when God brings his firstborn into the world, he says, "Let all God's angels worship him."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.7">About the angels he says, "He makes his angels spirits, and his servants flames of fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.8">But about the Son he says, "Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.9">You have loved doing what's right<note type="translation">Greek: righteousness</note> and hated lawlessness; therefore God, your God, has poured oil on you<note type="translation">Greek: anointed you</note> with the oil of joy more than on your companions."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.10">He also says, "In the beginning, Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.11">They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.12">You will roll them up like a robe; like a garment they will be changed. But you remain the same, and your years will never end."</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.13">To which of the angels did God ever say, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet"?</verse>
        <verse osisID="Heb.1.14">Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?</verse>
