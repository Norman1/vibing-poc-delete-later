      <title type="sub">Israel Fights the Remaining Canaanites</title>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.1">After the death of Joshua, the Israelites asked Yahweh, "Who of us is to go up first to fight against the Canaanites?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.2">Yahweh answered, "Judah shall go up; I have given the land into their hands."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.3">The men of Judah then said to the Simeonites their fellow Israelites, "Come up with us into the territory allotted to us, to fight against the Canaanites. We in turn will go with you into yours." So the Simeonites went with them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.4">When Judah attacked, Yahweh gave the Canaanites and Perizzites into their hands, and they struck down ten thousand men at Bezek.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.5">It was there that they found Adoni-Bezek and fought against him, putting to rout the Canaanites and Perizzites.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.6">Adoni-Bezek fled, but they chased him and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.7">Then Adoni-Bezek said, "Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off have picked up scraps under my table. Now God has paid me back for what I did to them." They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.8">The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem also and took it. They put the city to the sword and set it on fire.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.9">After that, Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites living in the hill country, the Negev and the western foothills.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.10">They advanced against the Canaanites living in Hebron (formerly called Kiriath Arba) and defeated Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.11">From there they advanced against the people living in Debir (formerly called Kiriath Sepher).</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.12">And Caleb said, "I will give my daughter Aksah in marriage to the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.13">Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it; so Caleb gave his daughter Aksah to him in marriage.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.14">One day when she came to Othniel, she urged him to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, "What can I do for you?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.15">She replied, "Do me a special favor. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me also springs of water." So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.16">The descendants of Moses' father-in-law, the Kenite, went up from the City of Palms with the people of Judah to live among the inhabitants of the Desert of Judah in the Negev near Arad.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.17">Then the men of Judah went with the Simeonites their fellow Israelites and attacked the Canaanites living in Zephath, and they totally destroyed the city. Therefore it was called Hormah.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.18">Judah also took Gaza, Ashkelon and Ekronâ€”each city with its territory.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.19">Yahweh was with the men of Judah. They took possession of the hill country, but they were unable to drive out the people from the plains, because they had chariots fitted with iron.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.20">As Moses had promised, Hebron was given to Caleb, who drove out from it the three sons of Anak.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.21">The Benjamites, however, did not drive out the Jebusites, who were living in Jerusalem; to this day the Jebusites live there with the Benjamites.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.22">Now the tribes of Joseph attacked Bethel, and Yahweh was with them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.23">When they sent men to spy out Bethel (formerly called Luz),</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.24">the spies saw a man coming out of the city and they said to him, "Show us how to get into the city and we will see that you are treated well."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.25">So he showed them, and they put the city to the sword but spared the man and his whole family.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.26">He then went to the land of the Hittites, where he built a city and called it Luz, which is its name to this day.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.27">But Manasseh did not drive out the people of Beth Shan or Taanach or Dor or Ibleam or Megiddo and their surrounding settlements, for the Canaanites were determined to live in that land.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.28">When Israel became strong, they pressed the Canaanites into forced labor but never drove them out completely.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.29">Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer, but the Canaanites continued to live there among them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.30">Neither did Zebulun drive out the Canaanites living in Kitron or Nahalol, so these Canaanites lived among them, but Zebulun did subject them to forced labor.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.31">Nor did Asher drive out those living in Akko or Sidon or Ahlab or Akzib or Helbah or Aphik or Rehob.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.32">The Asherites lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land because they did not drive them out.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.33">Neither did Naphtali drive out those living in Beth Shemesh or Beth Anath; but the Naphtalites too lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land, and those living in Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath became forced laborers for them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.34">The Amorites confined the Danites to the hill country, not allowing them to come down into the plain.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.35">And the Amorites were determined also to hold out in Mount Heres, Aijalon and Shaalbim, but when the tribes of Joseph became stronger, they too were pressed into forced labor.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.1.36">The boundary of the Amorites was from Scorpion Pass to Sela and beyond.</verse>
      <chapter eID="Judg.1"/>
      
      <chapter osisID="Judg.2" sID="Judg.2"/>
      <title type="sub">The Angel of Yahweh at Bokim</title>
      <verse osisID="Judg.2.1">The angel of Yahweh went up from Gilgal to Bokim and said, "I brought you up out of Egypt and led you into the land I swore to give to your ancestors. I said, 'I will never break my covenant with you,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.2.2">and you shall not make a covenant with the people of this land, but you shall break down their altars.' Yet you have disobeyed me. Why have you done this?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.2.3">And I have also said, 'I will not drive them out before you; they will become traps for you, and their gods will become snares to you.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.2.4">When the angel of Yahweh had spoken these things to all the Israelites, the people wept aloud,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.2.5">and they called that place Bokim. There they offered sacrifices to Yahweh.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Disobedience and Defeat</title>
      <verse osisID="Judg.2.6">After Joshua had dismissed the Israelites, they went to take possession of the land, each to their own inheritance.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.2.7">The people served Yahweh throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had seen all the great things Yahweh had done for Israel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.2.8">Joshua son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died at the age of a hundred and ten.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.2.9">And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath Heres in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.2.10">After that whole generation had been gathered to their ancestors, another generation grew up who knew neither Yahweh nor what he had done for Israel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.2.11">Then the Israelites did evil in the eyes of Yahweh and served the Baals.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.2.12">They forsook Yahweh, the God of their ancestors, who had brought them out of Egypt. They followed and worshiped various gods of the peoples around them. They aroused Yahweh's anger</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.2.13">because they forsook him and served Baal and the Ashtoreths.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.2.14">In his anger against Israel Yahweh gave them into the hands of raiders who plundered them. He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, whom they were no longer able to resist.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.2.15">Whenever Israel went out to fight, the hand of Yahweh was against them to defeat them, just as he had sworn to them. They were in great distress.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.2.16">Then Yahweh raised up judges, who saved them out of the hands of these raiders.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.2.17">Yet they would not listen to their judges but prostituted themselves to other gods and worshiped them. They quickly turned from the ways of their ancestors, who had been obedient to Yahweh's commands.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.2.18">Whenever Yahweh raised up a judge for them, he was with the judge and saved them out of the hands of their enemies as long as the judge lived; for Yahweh relented because of their groaning under those who oppressed and afflicted them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.2.19">But when the judge died, the people returned to ways even more corrupt than those of their ancestors, following other gods and serving and worshiping them. They refused to give up their evil practices and stubborn ways.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.2.20">Therefore Yahweh was very angry with Israel and said, "Because this nation has violated the covenant I ordained for their ancestors and has not listened to me,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.2.21">I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations Joshua left when he died.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.2.22">I will use them to test Israel and see whether they will keep the way of Yahweh and walk in it as their ancestors did."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.2.23">Yahweh had allowed those nations to remain; he did not drive them out at once by giving them into the hands of Joshua.</verse>
      <chapter eID="Judg.2"/>
      
      <chapter osisID="Judg.3" sID="Judg.3"/>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.1">These are the nations Yahweh left to test all those Israelites who had not experienced any of the wars in Canaan</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.2">(he did this only to teach warfare to the descendants of the Israelites who had not had previous battle experience):</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.3">the five rulers of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites living in the Lebanon mountains from Mount Baal Hermon to Lebo Hamath.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.4">They were left to test the Israelites to see whether they would obey Yahweh's commands, which he had given their ancestors through Moses.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.5">The Israelites lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.6">They took their daughters in marriage and gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their gods.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Othniel</title>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.7">The Israelites did evil in the eyes of Yahweh; they forgot Yahweh their God and served the Baals and the Asherahs.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.8">The anger of Yahweh burned against Israel so that he sold them into the hands of Cushan-Rishathaim king of Aram Naharaim, to whom the Israelites were subject for eight years.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.9">But when they cried out to Yahweh, he raised up for them a deliverer, Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, who saved them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.10">The Spirit of Yahweh came on him, so that he became Israel's judge and went to war. Yahweh gave Cushan-Rishathaim king of Aram into his hands, so that he subdued him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.11">So the land had peace for forty years, until Othniel son of Kenaz died.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Ehud</title>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.12">Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and because they did this evil Yahweh gave Eglon king of Moab power over Israel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.13">Getting the Ammonites and Amalekites to join him, Eglon came and attacked Israel, and they took possession of the City of Palms.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.14">The Israelites were subject to Eglon king of Moab for eighteen years.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.15">Again the Israelites cried out to Yahweh, and he gave them a delivererâ€”Ehud, a left-handed man, the son of Gera the Benjamite. The Israelites sent him with tribute to Eglon king of Moab.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.16">Now Ehud had made a double-edged sword about a cubit long, which he strapped to his right thigh under his clothing.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.17">He presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab, who was a very fat man.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.18">After Ehud had presented the tribute, he sent on their way those who had carried it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.19">But on reaching the stone images near Gilgal he himself went back to Eglon and said, "Your Majesty, I have a secret message for you." The king said to his attendants, "Leave us!" And they all left.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.20">Ehud then approached him while he was sitting alone in the upper room of his palace and said, "I have a message from God for you." As the king rose from his seat,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.21">Ehud reached with his left hand, drew the sword from his right thigh and plunged it into the king's belly.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.22">Even the handle sank in after the blade, and his bowels discharged. Ehud did not pull the sword out, and the fat closed in over it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.23">Then Ehud went out to the porch; he shut the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.24">After he had gone, the servants came and found the doors of the upper room locked. They said, "He must be relieving himself in the inner room of the palace."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.25">They waited to the point of embarrassment, but when he did not open the doors of the room, they took a key and unlocked them. There they saw their lord fallen to the floor, dead.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.26">While they waited, Ehud got away. He passed by the stone images and escaped to Seirah.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.27">When he arrived there, he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites went down with him from the hills, with him leading them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.28">"Follow me," he ordered, "for Yahweh has given Moab, your enemy, into your hands." So they followed him down and took possession of the fords of the Jordan that led to Moab; they allowed no one to cross over.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.29">At that time they struck down about ten thousand Moabites, all vigorous and strong; not one escaped.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.30">That day Moab was made subject to Israel, and the land had peace for eighty years.</verse>
      
      <title type="sub">Shamgar</title>
      <verse osisID="Judg.3.31">After Ehud came Shamgar son of Anath, who struck down six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad. He too saved Israel.</verse>
      <chapter eID="Judg.3"/>
      
      <chapter osisID="Judg.4" sID="Judg.4"/>
      <title type="sub">Deborah</title>
      <verse osisID="Judg.4.1">Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, now that Ehud was dead.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.4.2">So Yahweh sold them into the hands of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. Sisera, the commander of his army, lived in Harosheth Haggoyim.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.4.3">Because he had nine hundred chariots fitted with iron and had cruelly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years, they cried to Yahweh for help.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.4.4">Now Deborah, a prophet, the wife of Lappidoth, was leading Israel at that time.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.4.5">She held court under the Palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites went up to her to have their disputes decided.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.4.6">She sent for Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him, "Yahweh, the God of Israel, commands you: 'Go, take with you ten thousand men of Naphtali and Zebulun and lead them up to Mount Tabor.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.4.7">I will lead Sisera, the commander of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his troops to the Kishon River and give him into your hands.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.4.8">Barak said to her, "If you go with me, I will go; but if you don't go with me, I won't go."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.4.9">"Certainly I will go with you," said Deborah. "But because of the course you are taking, the honor will not be yours, for Yahweh will deliver Sisera into the hands of a woman." So Deborah went with Barak to Kedesh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.4.10">There Barak summoned Zebulun and Naphtali, and ten thousand men went up under his command. Deborah also went up with him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.4.11">Now Heber the Kenite had left the other Kenites, the descendants of Hobab, Moses' brother-in-law, and pitched his tent by the great tree in Zaanannim near Kedesh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.4.12">When they told Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.4.13">Sisera summoned from Harosheth Haggoyim to the Kishon River all his men and his nine hundred chariots fitted with iron.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.4.14">Then Deborah said to Barak, "Go! This is the day Yahweh has given Sisera into your hands. Has not Yahweh gone ahead of you?" So Barak went down Mount Tabor, with ten thousand men following him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.4.15">At Barak's advance, Yahweh routed Sisera and all his chariots and army by the sword, and Sisera got down from his chariot and fled on foot.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.4.16">Barak pursued the chariots and army as far as Harosheth Haggoyim, and all Sisera's troops fell by the sword; not a man was left.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.4.17">Sisera, meanwhile, fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because there was an alliance between Jabin king of Hazor and the family of Heber the Kenite.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.4.18">Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, "Come, my lord, come right in. Don't be afraid." So he entered her tent, and she covered him with a blanket.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.4.19">"I'm thirsty," he said. "Please give me some water." She opened a skin of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him up.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.4.20">"Stand in the doorway of the tent," he told her. "If someone comes by and asks you, 'Is anyone in there?' say 'No.'"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.4.21">But Jael, Heber's wife, picked up a tent peg and a hammer and went quietly to him while he lay fast asleep, exhausted. She drove the peg through his temple into the ground, and he died.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.4.22">Just then Barak came by in pursuit of Sisera, and Jael went out to meet him. "Come," she said, "I will show you the man you're looking for." So he went in with her, and there lay Sisera with the tent peg through his templeâ€”dead.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.4.23">On that day God subdued Jabin king of Canaan before the Israelites.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.4.24">And the hand of the Israelites pressed harder and harder against Jabin king of Canaan until they destroyed him.</verse>
      <chapter eID="Judg.4"/>
      
      <chapter osisID="Judg.5" sID="Judg.5"/>
      <title type="sub">The Song of Deborah</title>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.1">On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.2">"When the princes in Israel take the lead, when the people willingly offer themselvesâ€” praise Yahweh!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.3">Hear this, you kings! Listen, you rulers! I, even I, will sing to Yahweh; I will praise Yahweh, the God of Israel, in song.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.4">When you, Yahweh, went out from Seir, when you marched from the land of Edom, the earth shook, the heavens poured, the clouds poured down water.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.5">The mountains quaked before Yahweh, the One of Sinai, before Yahweh, the God of Israel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.6">In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were abandoned; travelers took to winding paths.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.7">Villagers in Israel would not fight; they held back until I, Deborah, arose, until I arose, a mother in Israel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.8">God chose new leaders when war came to the city gates, but not a shield or spear was seen among forty thousand in Israel.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.9">My heart is with Israel's princes, with the willing volunteers among the people. Praise Yahweh!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.10">You who ride on white donkeys, sitting on your saddle blankets, and you who walk along the road, consider</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.11">the voice of the singers at the watering places. They recite the victories of Yahweh, the victories of his villagers in Israel. Then the people of Yahweh went down to the city gates.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.12">Wake up, wake up, Deborah! Wake up, wake up, break out in song! Arise, Barak! Take captive your captives, son of Abinoam.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.13">The remnant of the nobles came down; the people of Yahweh came down to me against the mighty.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.14">Some came from Ephraim, whose roots were in Amalek; Benjamin was with the people who followed you. From Makir captains came down, from Zebulun those who bear a commander's staff.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.15">The princes of Issachar were with Deborah; yes, Issachar was with Barak, sent under his command into the valley. In the districts of Reuben there was much searching of heart.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.16">Why did you stay among the sheep pens to hear the whistling for the flocks? In the districts of Reuben there was much searching of heart.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.17">Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan. And Dan, why did he linger by the ships? Asher remained on the coast and stayed in his coves.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.18">The people of Zebulun risked their very lives; so did Naphtali on the terraced fields.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.19">Kings came, they fought, the kings of Canaan fought. At Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo, they took no plunder of silver.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.20">From the heavens the stars fought, from their courses they fought against Sisera.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.21">The river Kishon swept them away, the age-old river, the river Kishon. March on, my soul; be strong!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.22">Then thundered the horses' hoovesâ€” galloping, galloping go his mighty steeds.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.23">'Curse Meroz,' said the angel of Yahweh. 'Curse its people bitterly, because they did not come to help Yahweh, to help Yahweh against the mighty.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.24">Most blessed of women be Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, most blessed of tent-dwelling women.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.25">He asked for water, and she gave him milk; in a bowl fit for nobles she brought him curdled milk.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.26">Her hand reached for the tent peg, her right hand for the workman's hammer. She struck Sisera, she crushed his head, she shattered and pierced his temple.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.27">At her feet he sank, he fell; there he lay. At her feet he sank, he fell; where he sank, there he fellâ€”dead.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.28">Through the window peered Sisera's mother; behind the lattice she cried out, 'Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why is the clatter of his chariots delayed?'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.29">The wisest of her ladies answer her; indeed, she keeps saying to herself,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.30">'Are they not finding and dividing the spoils: a woman or two for each man, colorful garments as plunder for Sisera, colorful garments embroidered, highly embroidered garments for my neckâ€” all this as plunder?'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.5.31">So may all your enemies perish, Yahweh! But may all who love you be like the sun when it rises in its strength." Then the land had peace forty years.</verse>

      <title type="sub">Gideon</title>
      <verse osisID="Judg.6.1">The Israelites did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and for seven years he gave them into the hands of the Midianites.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.6.2">Because the power of Midian was so oppressive, the Israelites prepared shelters for themselves in mountain clefts, caves and strongholds.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.6.3">Whenever the Israelites planted their crops, the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples invaded the country.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.6.4">They camped on the land and ruined the crops all the way to Gaza and did not spare a living thing for Israel, neither sheep nor cattle nor donkeys.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.6.5">They came up with their livestock and their tents like swarms of locusts. It was impossible to count them or their camels; they invaded the land to ravage it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.6.6">Midian so impoverished the Israelites that they cried out to Yahweh for help.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.6.7">When the Israelites cried out to Yahweh because of Midian,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.6.8">he sent them a prophet, who said, "This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: I brought you up out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.6.9">I rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians. And I delivered you from the hand of all your oppressors; I drove them out before you and gave you their land.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.6.10">I said to you, 'I am Yahweh your God; do not worship the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you live.' But you have not listened to me."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.6.11">The angel of Yahweh came and sat down under the oak in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, where his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to keep it from the Midianites.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.6.12">When the angel of Yahweh appeared to Gideon, he said, "Yahweh is with you, mighty warrior."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.6.13">"Pardon me, my lord," Gideon replied, "but if Yahweh is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonders that our ancestors told us about when they said, 'Did not Yahweh bring us up out of Egypt?' But now Yahweh has abandoned us and given us into the hand of Midian."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.6.14">Yahweh turned to him and said, "Go in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midian's hand. Am I not sending you?"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.6.15">"Pardon me, my lord," Gideon replied, "but how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.6.16">Yahweh answered, "I will be with you, and you will strike down all the Midianites, leaving none alive."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.6.17">Gideon replied, "If now I have found favor in your eyes, give me a sign that it is really you talking to me.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.6.18">Please do not go away until I come back and bring my offering and set it before you." And Yahweh said, "I will wait until you return."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.6.19">Gideon went inside, prepared a young goat, and from an ephah of flour he made bread without yeast. Putting the meat in a basket and its broth in a pot, he brought them out and offered them to him under the oak.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.6.20">The angel of God said to him, "Take the meat and the unleavened bread, place them on this rock, and pour out the broth." And Gideon did so.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.6.21">Then the angel of Yahweh touched the meat and the unleavened bread with the tip of the staff that was in his hand. Fire flared from the rock, consuming the meat and the bread. And the angel of Yahweh disappeared.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.6.22">When Gideon realized that it was the angel of Yahweh, he exclaimed, "Alas, Sovereign Yahweh! I have seen the angel of Yahweh face to face!"</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.6.23">But Yahweh said to him, "Peace! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Judg.6.24">So Gideon built an altar to Yahweh there and called it Yahweh-Shalom. To this day it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</verse>
