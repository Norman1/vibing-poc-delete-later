      <chapter osisID="Job.1" sID="Job.1"/>
      <verse osisID="Job.1.1">There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.1.2">Seven sons and three daughters were born to him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.1.3">He owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and had a very large household. This man was the greatest of all the people of the east.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.1.4">His sons used to hold feasts in one another's houses in turn, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.1.5">When the days of feasting had run their course, Job would send and consecrate them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, "It may be that my children have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts." This is what Job always did.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.1.6">Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, and Satan also came among them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.1.7"><divineName>Yahweh</divineName> said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> and said, "From going back and forth on the earth, and from walking up and down on it."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.1.8"><divineName>Yahweh</divineName> said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.1.9">Then Satan answered <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> and said, "Does Job fear God for nothing?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.1.10">Have you not put a hedge around him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.1.11">But stretch out your hand and touch all that he has, and he will curse you to your face."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.1.12"><divineName>Yahweh</divineName> said to Satan, "Behold, all that he has is in your power; only do not stretch out your hand against him." So Satan went out from the presence of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.1.13">Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.1.14">and there came a messenger to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.1.15">and the Sabeans fell upon them and took them and killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.1.16">While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, "The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.1.17">While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, "The Chaldeans formed three companies and made a raid on the camels and took them and killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.1.18">While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, "Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.1.19">and behold, a great wind came across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people, and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to tell you."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.1.20">Then Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head and fell on the ground and worshiped.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.1.21">And he said, "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return. <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> gave, and <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> has taken away; blessed be the name of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.1.22">In all this Job did not sin or charge God with wrong.</verse>
      <chapter eID="Job.1"/>
      <chapter osisID="Job.2" sID="Job.2"/>
      <verse osisID="Job.2.1">Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>, and Satan also came among them to present himself before <divineName>Yahweh</divineName>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.2.2"><divineName>Yahweh</divineName> said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> and said, "From going back and forth on the earth, and from walking up and down on it."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.2.3"><divineName>Yahweh</divineName> said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil. He still holds fast his integrity, although you incited me against him to destroy him without reason."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.2.4">Then Satan answered <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> and said, "Skin for skin! All that a man has he will give for his life.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.2.5">But stretch out your hand and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse you to your face."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.2.6"><divineName>Yahweh</divineName> said to Satan, "Behold, he is in your hand; only spare his life."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.2.7">So Satan went out from the presence of <divineName>Yahweh</divineName> and struck Job with loathsome sores from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.2.8">And he took a potsherd with which to scrape himself while he sat in the ashes.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.2.9">Then his wife said to him, "Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.2.10">But he said to her, "You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. Shall we receive good from God, and shall we not receive evil?" In all this Job did not sin with his lips.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.2.11">Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, they came each from his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They made an appointment together to come to show him sympathy and comfort him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.2.12">And when they saw him from a distance, they did not recognize him. And they raised their voices and wept, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads toward heaven.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.2.13">And they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his suffering was very great.</verse>
      <chapter eID="Job.2"/>
      <chapter osisID="Job.3" sID="Job.3"/>
      <verse osisID="Job.3.1">After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.3.2">And Job said:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.3.3">"Let the day perish on which I was born, and the night that said, 'A man is conceived.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.3.4">Let that day be darkness! May God above not seek it, nor light shine upon it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.3.5">Let gloom and deep darkness claim it. Let clouds dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.3.6">That night—let thick darkness seize it! Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.3.7">Behold, let that night be barren; let no joyful cry enter it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.3.8">Let those curse it who curse the day, who are ready to rouse up Leviathan.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.3.9">Let the stars of its dawn be dark; let it hope for light, but have none, nor see the eyelids of the morning,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.3.10">because it did not shut the doors of my mother's womb, nor hide trouble from my eyes.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.3.11">"Why did I not die at birth, come out from the womb and expire?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.3.12">Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts, that I should nurse?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.3.13">For then I would have lain down and been quiet; I would have slept; then I would have been at rest,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.3.14">with kings and counselors of the earth who rebuilt ruins for themselves,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.3.15">or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.3.16">Or why was I not as a hidden stillborn child, as infants who never see the light?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.3.17">There the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary are at rest.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.3.18">There the prisoners are at ease together; they hear not the voice of the taskmaster.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.3.19">The small and the great are there, and the slave is free from his master.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.3.20">"Why is light given to him who is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.3.21">who long for death, but it comes not, and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.3.22">who rejoice exceedingly and are glad when they find the grave?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.3.23">Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.3.24">For my sighing comes instead of my bread, and my groanings are poured out like water.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.3.25">For the thing that I fear comes upon me, and what I dread befalls me.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.3.26">I am not at ease, nor am I quiet; I have no rest, but trouble comes."</verse>
      <chapter eID="Job.3"/>
      <chapter osisID="Job.4" sID="Job.4"/>
      <verse osisID="Job.4.1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.4.2">"If one ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? But who can keep from speaking?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.4.3">Behold, you have instructed many, and you have strengthened the weak hands.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.4.4">Your words have upheld him who was stumbling, and you have made firm the feeble knees.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.4.5">But now it has come to you, and you are impatient; it touches you, and you are dismayed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.4.6">Is not your fear of God your confidence, and the integrity of your ways your hope?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.4.7">"Remember: who that was innocent ever perished? Or where were the upright cut off?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.4.8">As I have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow trouble reap the same.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.4.9">By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of his anger they are consumed.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.4.10">The roar of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, the teeth of the young lions are broken.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.4.11">The strong lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.4.12">"Now a word was brought to me stealthily; my ear received the whisper of it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.4.13">Amid thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.4.14">dread came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones shake.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.4.15">A spirit glided past my face; the hair of my flesh stood up.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.4.16">It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes; there was silence, then I heard a voice:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.4.17">'Can mortal man be in the right before God? Can a man be pure before his Maker?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.4.18">Even in his servants he puts no trust, and his angels he charges with error;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.4.19">how much more those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed like the moth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.4.20">Between morning and evening they are beaten to pieces; they perish forever without anyone regarding it.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.4.21">Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them? They die, and not in wisdom.'"</verse>
      <chapter eID="Job.4"/>
      <chapter osisID="Job.5" sID="Job.5"/>
      <verse osisID="Job.5.1">"Call now; is there anyone who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.5.2">Surely vexation kills the fool, and jealousy slays the simple.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.5.3">I have seen the fool taking root, but suddenly I cursed his dwelling.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.5.4">His children are far from safety; they are crushed in the gate, and there is no one to deliver them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.5.5">The hungry eat his harvest, and he takes it even out of thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.5.6">For affliction does not come from the dust, nor does trouble sprout from the ground,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.5.7">but man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.5.8">"As for me, I would seek God, and to God would I commit my cause,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.5.9">who does great things and unsearchable, marvelous things without number:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.5.10">he gives rain on the earth and sends waters on the fields;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.5.11">he sets on high those who are lowly, and those who mourn are lifted to safety.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.5.12">He frustrates the devices of the crafty, so that their hands achieve no success.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.5.13">He catches the wise in their own craftiness, and the schemes of the wily are brought to a quick end.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.5.14">They meet with darkness in the daytime and grope at noonday as in the night.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.5.15">But he saves the needy from the sword of their mouth and from the hand of the mighty.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.5.16">So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts her mouth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.5.17">"Behold, blessed is the one whom God reproves; therefore despise not the discipline of the Almighty.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.5.18">For he wounds, but he binds up; he shatters, but his hands heal.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.5.19">He will deliver you from six troubles; in seven no evil shall touch you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.5.20">In famine he will redeem you from death, and in war from the power of the sword.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.5.21">You shall be hidden from the lash of the tongue, and shall not fear destruction when it comes.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.5.22">At destruction and famine you shall laugh, and shall not fear the beasts of the earth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.5.23">For you shall be in league with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.5.24">You shall know that your tent is at peace, and you shall inspect your fold and miss nothing.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.5.25">You shall know also that your offspring shall be many, and your descendants as the grass of the earth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.5.26">You shall come to your grave in ripe old age, like a sheaf gathered up in its season.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.5.27">Behold, this we have searched out; it is true. Hear, and know it for your good."</verse>
      <chapter eID="Job.5"/>
      <chapter osisID="Job.6" sID="Job.6"/>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.1">Then Job answered and said:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.2">"Oh that my vexation were weighed, and all my calamity laid in the balances!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.3">For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea; therefore my words have been rash.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.4">For the arrows of the Almighty are in me; my spirit drinks their poison; the terrors of God are arrayed against me.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.5">Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass, or the ox low over his fodder?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.6">Can that which is tasteless be eaten without salt, or is there any taste in the juice of the mallow?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.7">My appetite refuses to touch them; they are as food that is loathsome to me.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.8">"Oh that I might have my request, and that God would fulfill my hope,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.9">that it would please God to crush me, that he would let loose his hand and cut me off!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.10">This would be my comfort; I would even exult in pain unsparing, for I have not denied the words of the Holy One.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.11">What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is my end, that I should be patient?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.12">Is my strength the strength of stones, or is my flesh bronze?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.13">Have I any help in me, when resource is driven from me?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.14">"He who withholds kindness from a friend forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.15">My brothers have dealt deceitfully like a brook, like the bed of brooks that pass away,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.16">which are dark with ice, and where the snow hides itself.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.17">When they melt, they disappear; when it is hot, they vanish from their place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.18">The caravans turn aside from their course; they go up into the waste and perish.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.19">The caravans of Tema look, the travelers of Sheba hope.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.20">They are disappointed because they were confident; they come there and are confounded.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.21">For you have now become nothing; you see my calamity and are afraid.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.22">Have I said, 'Make me a gift'? Or, 'From your wealth offer a bribe for me'?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.23">Or, 'Deliver me from the adversary's hand'? Or, 'Redeem me from the hand of the ruthless'?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.24">"Teach me, and I will be silent; make me understand how I have gone astray.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.25">How forceful are upright words! But what does your arguing reprove?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.26">Do you think that you can reprove words, when the speech of a despairing man is wind?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.27">You would even cast lots over the fatherless, and bargain over your friend.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.28">"But now, be pleased to look at me, for I will not lie to your face.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.29">Please turn; let no injustice be done. Turn now; my vindication is at stake.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.6.30">Is there any injustice on my tongue? Cannot my palate discern the cause of calamity?"</verse>

      <verse osisID="Job.7.1">"Does not humanity have hard service on earth? Are not his days like the days of a hired laborer?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.7.2">Like a slave who pants for shade, and like a hired laborer who looks for his wages,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.7.3">so I am allotted months of emptiness, and nights of misery are appointed for me.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.7.4">When I lie down I say, 'When shall I arise?' But the night is long, and I am full of tossing until dawn.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.7.5">My flesh is clothed with worms and dirt; my skin hardens and then breaks out afresh.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.7.6">My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle and come to their end without hope.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Job.8.1">Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.8.2">"How long will you say these things, and the words of your mouth be a great wind?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.8.3">Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.8.4">If your children have sinned against him, he has delivered them into the hand of their transgression.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.8.5">If you will seek God and plead with the Almighty for mercy,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.8.6">if you are pure and upright, surely then he will rouse himself for you and restore your righteous dwelling place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.8.7">And though your beginning was small, your latter days will be very great.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.8.8">"For ask, please, of former generations, and consider what their fathers have searched out.</verse>

      <verse osisID="Job.31.2">What would be my portion from God above and my heritage from the Almighty on high?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.3">Is not calamity for the unrighteous, and disaster for the workers of iniquity?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.4">Does not he see my ways and number all my steps?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.5">"If I have walked with falsehood and my foot has hastened to deceit—</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.6">let me be weighed in a just balance, and let God know my integrity!—</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.7">if my step has turned aside from the way, and my heart has gone after my eyes, and if any spot has stuck to my hands,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.8">then let me sow, and another eat, and let what grows for me be rooted out.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.9">"If my heart has been enticed toward a woman, and I have lain in wait at my neighbor's door,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.10">then let my wife grind for another, and let others bow down on her.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.11">For that would be a heinous crime; that would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.12">for that would be a fire that consumes as far as Abaddon, and it would burn to the root all my increase.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.13">"If I have rejected the cause of my male or female servant, when they brought a complaint against me,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.14">what then shall I do when God rises up? When he makes inquiry, what shall I answer him?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.15">Did not he who made me in the womb make him? And did not one fashion us in the womb?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.16">"If I have withheld anything that the poor desired, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.17">or have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless has not eaten of it</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.18">(for from my youth the fatherless grew up with me as with a father, and from my mother's womb I guided the widow),</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.19">if I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing, or the needy without covering,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.20">if his body has not blessed me, and if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.21">if I have raised my hand against the fatherless, because I saw my help in the gate,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.22">then let my shoulder blade fall from my shoulder, and let my arm be broken from its socket.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.23">For I was in terror of calamity from God, and I could not have faced his majesty.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.24">"If I have made gold my trust or called fine gold my confidence,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.25">if I have rejoiced because my wealth was abundant or because my hand had found much,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.26">if I have looked at the sun when it shone, or the moon moving in splendor,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.27">and my heart has been secretly enticed, and my mouth has kissed my hand,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.28">this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges, for I would have been false to God above.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.29">"If I have rejoiced at the ruin of him who hated me, or exulted when evil found him</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.30">(I have not let my mouth sin by asking for his life with a curse),</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.31">if the men of my tent have not said, 'Who is there that has not been filled with his meat?'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.32">(the sojourner has not lodged in the street; I have opened my doors to the traveler),</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.33">if I have concealed my transgressions as others do by hiding my iniquity in my heart,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.34">because I stood in great fear of the multitude, and the contempt of families terrified me, so that I kept silence, and did not go out of doors—</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.35">Oh, that I had one to hear me! (Here is my signature! Let the Almighty answer me!) Oh, that I had the indictment written by my adversary!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.36">Surely I would carry it on my shoulder; I would bind it on me like a crown;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.37">I would give him an account of all my steps; like a prince I would approach him.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.38">"If my land has cried out against me and its furrows have wept together,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.39">if I have eaten its yield without payment and made its owners breathe their last,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.40">let thorns grow instead of wheat, and foul weeds instead of barley."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.31.40b">The words of Job are ended.</verse>

      <title type="main">Elihu Speaks</title>
      <verse osisID="Job.32.1">So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was right in his own eyes.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.32.2">Then Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became angry. He was angry at Job for declaring himself more right than God.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.32.3">He was also angry at the three friends, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.32.4">Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were older than he.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.32.5">When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, he became angry.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.32.6">And Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite answered and said: "I am young in years, and you are old; that is why I held back and was afraid to tell you what I know.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.32.7">I thought, 'Let days speak, and many years should teach wisdom.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.32.8">But it is the spirit in a person, the breath of the Almighty, that gives them understanding.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.32.9">It is not only the old who are wise, nor only the aged who understand justice.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.32.10">Therefore I say: Listen to me; I too will tell you what I know.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.32.11">Look, I waited for your words, I listened to your reasoning while you searched for what to say.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.32.12">I gave you my full attention, but not one of you has proved Job wrong; none of you has answered his arguments.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.32.13">Do not say, 'We have found wisdom; let God refute him, not a human.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.32.14">But Job has not marshaled his words against me, and I will not answer him with your arguments.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.32.15">They are dismayed and have no more to say; words have failed them.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.32.16">Must I wait, now that they are silent, now that they stand there with no reply?</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.32.17">I too will have my say; I too will tell what I know.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.32.18">For I am full of words, and the spirit within me compels me;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.32.19">inside I am like bottled-up wine, like new wineskins ready to burst.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.32.20">I must speak and find relief; I must open my lips and reply.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.32.21">I will show no partiality, nor will I flatter anyone;</verse>
      <verse osisID="Job.32.22">for if I were skilled in flattery, my Maker would soon take me away."</verse>
