      <title>Third Letter of John</title>
      <div type="chapter" osisID="3John.1">
        <verse osisID="3John.1.1">
          <note type="study" n="1">The Greek word "presbyter" literally means "elder" but functioned as a church leader or overseer in early Christian communities.</note>
          This letter is from the church leader to my dear friend Gaius, whom I genuinely love.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="3John.1.2">
          Dear friend, I pray that you're doing well in every way and that your physical health matches the good health of your soul.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="3John.1.3">
          I was overjoyed when some fellow believers came and told me how faithfully you're living according to the truth.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="3John.1.4">
          Nothing makes me happier than hearing that my spiritual children are living according to the truth.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="3John.1.5">
          <note type="study" n="2">The Greek emphasizes showing faithful love through actions, particularly hospitality to traveling Christian workers.</note>
          Dear friend, you're showing true faithfulness whenever you help fellow believers, especially those you don't even know.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="3John.1.6">
          They've told the whole church here about your love. Please continue helping them on their journey in a way that honors God.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="3John.1.7">
          <note type="study" n="3">"The Name" refers to Jesus Christ. Early Christians often used this shorthand, similar to how Jews avoided saying God's name directly.</note>
          They left to serve Christ without accepting any support from non-believers.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="3John.1.8">
          So we should support people like this, becoming partners with them in spreading the truth.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="3John.1.9">
          <note type="study" n="4">Diotrephes appears to be a local church leader who was rejecting John's authority and refusing to welcome traveling missionaries.</note>
          I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves being in charge, won't accept our authority.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="3John.1.10">
          <note type="study" n="5">The Greek term means "bringing charges with evil words" - essentially making malicious accusations.</note>
          So when I come, I'll call out what he's doing—spreading malicious rumors about us. Not satisfied with that, he refuses to welcome fellow believers himself and stops others who want to help them, even kicking them out of the church.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="3John.1.11">
          Dear friend, don't copy what's evil but copy what's good. People who do good show they belong to God, but people who do evil show they don't really know God.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="3John.1.12">
          Everyone speaks well of Demetrius—even the truth itself vouches for him. We also speak well of him, and you know our testimony is reliable.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="3John.1.13">
          I have much more to tell you, but I don't want to write it with pen and ink.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="3John.1.14">
          <note type="study" n="6">The Greek literally says "mouth to mouth," an idiom meaning face-to-face conversation.</note>
          I hope to see you soon so we can talk face to face.
        </verse>
        <verse osisID="3John.1.15">
          <note type="study" n="7">"Peace" translates the Greek "eirene," equivalent to the Hebrew "shalom"—meaning complete well-being, not just absence of conflict.</note>
          May you have peace. Our friends here send their greetings. Please give our personal greetings to each of our friends there.
