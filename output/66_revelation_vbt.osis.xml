      <chapter osisID="Rev.1" sID="Rev.1"/>
      <title type="main">Introduction and Greeting</title>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.1">This is the revelation<note type="translation">The Greek word "apokalypsis" means unveiling or disclosure</note> of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.2">who testified to everything he saw—the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.3">Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear it and keep what is written in it, because the time is near.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.4">John, to the seven churches in the province of Asia: Grace and peace to you from him who is, and who was, and who is to come, and from the seven spirits before his throne,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.5">and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.6">and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father—to him be glory and power for ever and ever! Amen.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.7">Look, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him; and all peoples on earth will mourn because of him. Yes, amen!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.8">"I am the Alpha and the Omega<note type="translation">The first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, meaning the beginning and the end</note>," says the Lord God, "who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty."</verse>
      <title type="sub">John's Vision of Christ</title>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.9">I, John, your brother and companion in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus, was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.10">On the Lord's Day I was in the Spirit, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.11">which said: "Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.12">I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me. And when I turned I saw seven golden lampstands,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.13">and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man, dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.14">The hair on his head was white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.15">His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.16">In his right hand he held seven stars, and coming out of his mouth was a sharp, double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.17">When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right hand on me and said: "Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.18">I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades<note type="translation">The Greek word "Hades" refers to the realm of the dead</note>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.19">Write, therefore, what you have seen, what is now and what will take place later.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.20">The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands is this: The seven stars are the angels<note type="translation">The Greek word "angelos" can mean angel or messenger</note> of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.</verse>

      <title type="main">Messages to the Seven Churches</title>
      <title type="sub">To the Church in Ephesus</title>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.1">"To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: These are the words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.2">I know your deeds, your hard work and your perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate wicked people, that you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not, and have found them false.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.3">You have persevered and have endured hardships for my name, and have not grown weary.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.4">Yet I hold this against you: You have forsaken the love you had at first.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.5">Consider how far you have fallen! Change your mind<note type="translation">The Greek word "metanoeo" means to change one's mind or way of thinking</note> and do the things you did at first. If you do not change your mind, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.6">But you have this in your favor: You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.7">Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.</verse>
      <title type="sub">To the Church in Smyrna</title>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.8">"To the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These are the words of him who is the First and the Last, who died and came to life again.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.9">I know your afflictions and your poverty—yet you are rich! I know about the slander<note type="translation">The Greek word "blasphemia" means speaking against or insulting</note> of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.10">Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you life as your victor's crown.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.11">Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who is victorious will not be hurt at all by the second death.</verse>
      <title type="sub">To the Church in Pergamum</title>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.12">"To the angel of the church in Pergamum write: These are the words of him who has the sharp, double-edged sword.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.13">I know where you live—where Satan has his throne. Yet you remain true to my name. You did not renounce your faith in me, not even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was put to death in your city—where Satan lives.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.14">Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: There are some among you who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to entice the Israelites to sin so that they ate food sacrificed to idols and committed sexual immorality.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.15">Likewise, you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.16">Change your mind therefore! Otherwise, I will soon come to you and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.17">Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who is victorious, I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give that person a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to the one who receives it.</verse>
      <title type="sub">To the Church in Thyatira</title>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.18">"To the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These are the words of the Son of God, whose eyes are like blazing fire and whose feet are like burnished bronze.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.19">I know your deeds, your love and faith, your service and perseverance, and that you are now doing more than you did at first.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.20">Nevertheless, I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophet. By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.21">I have given her time to change her mind about her immorality, but she is unwilling.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.22">So I will cast her on a bed of suffering, and I will make those who commit adultery with her suffer intensely, unless they change their minds about her ways.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.23">I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am he who searches hearts and minds<note type="translation">The Greek literally says "kidneys and hearts," referring to the innermost being</note>, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.24">Now I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, to you who do not hold to her teaching and have not learned Satan's so-called deep secrets, 'I will not impose any other burden on you,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.25">except to hold on to what you have until I come.'</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.26">To the one who is victorious and does my will to the end, I will give authority over the nations—</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.27">that one 'will rule them with an iron scepter and will dash them to pieces like pottery'—just as I have received authority from my Father.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.28">I will also give that one the morning star.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.2.29">Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
