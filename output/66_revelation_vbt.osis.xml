      <verse osisID="Rev.1.1">This is the revelation<note type="translation">The Greek word "apokalypsis" means unveiling or disclosure</note> of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.2">who testified to everything he saw—the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.3">Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear it and keep what is written in it, because the time is near.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.4">John, to the seven churches in the province of Asia: Grace and peace to you from him who is, and who was, and who is to come, and from the seven spirits before his throne,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.5">and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.6">and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father—to him be glory and power for ever and ever! Amen.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.7">Look, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him; and all peoples on earth will mourn because of him. Yes, amen!</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.8">"I am the Alpha and the Omega<note type="translation">The first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, meaning the beginning and the end</note>," says the Lord God, "who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty."</verse>
      <title type="sub">John's Vision of Christ</title>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.9">I, John, your brother and companion in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus, was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.10">On the Lord's Day I was in the Spirit, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.11">which said: "Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea."</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.12">I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me. And when I turned I saw seven golden lampstands,</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.13">and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man, dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.14">The hair on his head was white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.15">His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.16">In his right hand he held seven stars, and coming out of his mouth was a sharp, double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.17">When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right hand on me and said: "Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.18">I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades<note type="translation">The Greek word "Hades" refers to the realm of the dead</note>.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.19">Write, therefore, what you have seen, what is now and what will take place later.</verse>
      <verse osisID="Rev.1.20">The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands is this: The seven stars are the angels<note type="translation">The Greek word "angelos" can mean angel or messenger</note> of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.</verse>
