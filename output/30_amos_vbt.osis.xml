        <p>Amos, a shepherd from Judah, prophesied against Israel during a time of prosperity and complacency. He condemned the nation's social injustice, religious hypocrisy, and oppression of the poor, warning that their wealth and religious rituals couldn't save them from coming judgment. The book emphasizes that true religion requires justice and righteousness, not just religious observance.</p>

        <verse osisID="Amos.7.8">Yahweh asked me, "What do you see, Amos?" I replied, "A plumb line." Then the Lord said, "I am setting a plumb line among my people Israel; I will no longer spare them.</verse>

        <verse osisID="Amos.7.13">but don't ever prophesy at Bethel again, for it is the king's sanctuary and a royal temple."</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Amos.7.14">So Amos answered Amaziah, "I was not a prophet or the son of a prophet; rather, I was a herdsman, and I took care of sycamore figs.</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Amos.7.15">But Yahweh took me from following the flock and said to me, 'Go, prophesy to my people Israel.'</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Amos.7.16">Now hear Yahweh's word: You say, 'Don't prophesy against Israel; don't preach against the house of Isaac.'</verse>
        
        <verse osisID="Amos.7.17">Therefore, this is what Yahweh says: 'Your wife will become a prostitute in the city, your sons and daughters will fall by the sword, and your land will be divided up with a measuring line. You yourself will die in a pagan land, and Israel will certainly go into exile from its homeland.'"</verse>
